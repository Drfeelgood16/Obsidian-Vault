Socrates wants to define justice again and he essentially uses the defeater for deontology: Suppose someone has lent you weapons and asks for them back during a fit of madness it is not wrong to lie to him and deny you have these weapons.

**Premise:** Simonides says that to repay a debt is good. 
**But:** A friend ought always to do good to a friend and never evil. 
**Therefore:** If the return of a deposit will harm the receiver it is not moral to make it.

Simonides thinks "justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him," which he termed debt.

**Premise:** Justice is useful to keep things safe
**Premise:** If you are good at something you are also good at the inverse-- like a boxer who is also good at defending.
**Conclusion:** Just men are good thieves.

A man who is ignorant of human nature has evil friends and good enemies. To him the doctrine of Simonides is not moral.

Polemarchus correctly separates being good and being a friend. Therefore the definition of justice being doing good to your friends and harm to your enemies is moot.


"Yes, he replied, and then Socrates will do as he always doesâ€”refuse to answer himself, but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one else." -Thrasymachus

#### Justice is the interest of the stronger -Thrasymachus
Justice, in reality, comes from the form of government you are under and the form of government arises from who is in power. Therefore justice is in the interest of the government aka the strong.

**Premise:** it is just for subjects to obey their ruler.
**Premise:** the rulers are liable to err and therefore make laws contrary to their interest.
**Conclusion:** Therefore it can be just for subjects to do things against the interest of the stronger

**Contradiction:** If justice is in the interest of the stronger it can't be just to do something against the interest of the stronger.

**Conclusion:** True justice must be something separate from the follies of man.


Thrasymachus redefines a ruler so that a ruler is only a ruler as long as does not err and when he does err he is not a ruler.

**Premise:** Arts care for the subject of their art, medicine only for the body, instead of for themselves.
**Premise:** The arts are the rulers of their subjects.
**Conclusion:** The art cares for the interest of the weaker in opposition to the definition of justice.

**Contradiction:** If rule is an art like any other, it would care for it's subjects like any other art. Therefore justice must consider the interests of the weaker, unlike the original definition.

The shepherd does good for their herd not for the animals gain, though that is the effect, but for their own gain.

Thrasymachus's speech about unjust winning starts with: "Because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd"

Socrates do not think being injustice is gainful.

#### Which is more gainful? Being just or unjust.
Thracymachus: Injustice is wise and virtuous while justice is simple and ignorant
