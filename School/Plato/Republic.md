Socrates wants to define justice again and he essentially uses the defeater for deontology: Suppose someone has lent you weapons and asks for them back during a fit of madness it is not wrong to lie to him and deny you have these weapons.

**Premise:** Simonides says that to repay a debt is good. 
**But:** A friend ought always to do good to a friend and never evil. 
**Therefore:** If the return of a deposit will harm the receiver it is not moral to make it

Simonides thinks "justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him," which he termed debt.

**Premise:** Justice is useful to keep things safe
**Premise:** If you are good at something you are also good at the inverse-- like a boxer who is also good at defending.
**Conclusion:** Just men are good thieves.

A man who is ignorant of human nature has evil friends and good enemies. To him the doctrine of Simonides is not moral.
