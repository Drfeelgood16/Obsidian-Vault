# Book 1
Socrates wants to define justice again and he essentially uses the defeater for deontology: Suppose someone has lent you weapons and asks for them back during a fit of madness it is not wrong to lie to him and deny you have these weapons.

**Premise:** Simonides says that to repay a debt is good. 
**But:** A friend ought always to do good to a friend and never evil. 
**Therefore:** If the return of a deposit will harm the receiver it is not moral to make it.

Simonides thinks "justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him," which he termed debt.

**Premise:** Justice is useful to keep things safe
**Premise:** If you are good at something you are also good at the inverse-- like a boxer who is also good at defending.
**Conclusion:** Just men are good thieves.

A man who is ignorant of human nature has evil friends and good enemies. To him the doctrine of Simonides is not moral.

Polemarchus correctly separates being good and being a friend. Therefore the definition of justice being doing good to your friends and harm to your enemies is moot.


"Yes, he replied, and then Socrates will do as he always doesâ€”refuse to answer himself, but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one else." -Thrasymachus

#### Justice is the interest of the stronger -Thrasymachus
Justice, in reality, comes from the form of government you are under and the form of government arises from who is in power. Therefore justice is in the interest of the government aka the strong.

**Premise:** it is just for subjects to obey their ruler.
**Premise:** the rulers are liable to err and therefore make laws contrary to their interest.
**Conclusion:** Therefore it can be just for subjects to do things against the interest of the stronger

**Contradiction:** If justice is in the interest of the stronger it can't be just to do something against the interest of the stronger.

**Conclusion:** True justice must be something separate from the follies of man.


Thrasymachus redefines a ruler so that a ruler is only a ruler as long as does not err and when he does err he is not a ruler.

**Premise:** Arts care for the subject of their art, medicine only for the body, instead of for themselves.
**Premise:** The arts are the rulers of their subjects.
**Conclusion:** The art cares for the interest of the weaker in opposition to the definition of justice.

**Contradiction:** If rule is an art like any other, it would care for it's subjects like any other art. Therefore justice must consider the interests of the weaker, unlike the original definition.

The shepherd does good for their herd not for the animals gain, though that is the effect, but for their own gain.

Thrasymachus's speech about unjust winning starts with: "Because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd"

Socrates do not think being injustice is gainful.

#### Which is more gainful? Being just or unjust.
Thracymachus: Injustice is wise and virtuous while justice is simple and ignorant.

**Premise:** The just man does not take advantage of another just man. But he will of an unjust man.
**Premise:** The unjust man will attempt to take advantage of all men.

Socrates tries to map these premises onto other arts which I do not think fit.

**Premise:** The artisan is wise, while the non-artisan is not wise on the subject of an art.
**Premise:** The artisan will attempt to exceed the non-artisan but not a fellow artisan. (I do not agree with this premise. Maybe only if you have literally reached perfection)
**Conclusion:** The wise will not desire more than his like, but more than his unlike. Therefore the just man is wise since this mold fits into him only.

**Premise:** Injustice creates divisions and hatred while justice imparts harmony and friendship.
**Therefore:** Injustice will make cooperation impossible.

**Premise:** The gods are just.
**Therefore:** He who is unjust is an enemy of the gods.

The end of a tool is that which can be best accomplished or only done by said tool.

The soul also has an end to which nothing else can fulfill. The end of the soul is the ability to command and deliberate and life itself.



**Premise:** the end of a thing is that which it excels the most at, or only it can accomplish
**Premise:** The soul is a thing
**Conclusion:** The soul has an end in which it excels the most at.
What the soul excels the most at is argued to be justice, deliberation, and most of all life. 

### In summary
The only conclusion reached is that being just is more gainful than unjust. Though I don't agree with the means through which they reached that position.
1. I do not think that the art of justice is similar to arts of navigation or shoe-making.
2. I can't agree with a premise supposing gods are real.
3. I also don't believe in a soul, and that justice is the end of the soul
What I do agree with is that a wholly evil man will create strife and will have a hard time cooperating.

# Book 2
**Glaucon:**
They say that to do injustice is good, but to suffer injustice is evil to greater extent than the good it injustice does. From the experience of these injustices, we create laws and governments to have neither the good nor the bad. Justice is a compromise between doing injustice and not being punished and suffering justice and having no recourse. Those who practice justice do so involuntarily because they do not possess the power to inflict injustice. If we were to give the just and unjust man the power to do unjust things we will find both of them doing injustices according to their desires.

If you gave a ring of invisibility to a just or unjust man both would not be able to keep from doing whatever they desired simply because no one could witness them in the act. If a man had this ring and did nothing with it most people around him would think him a fool.

It is better to seem just than to be just. If we give the unjust man the riches and rhetoric to seem just while doing unjust deeds while we give the just man a veneer of injustice we will see that the unjust man will live a happier life.

**Adeimantus:**
The reason we teach our children to be just is to gain the image of justness for the benefits which Glaucon mentioned. Poets like Homer and Hesiod both mention rulers who appear just and the benefits it brings.
