A Ziggurat is an ancient [[Sumer|sumerian]] terraced structure with a temple on top. It is made out of unfired sun-dried bricks with a top layer of fired bricks. A Ziggurat can range in size from several stories to a single platform. It usually served as a temple complex with lower stories having housing and other buildings. Ziggurats were not places for public worship since it is believed the gods themselves resided in them and thus only priests set foot in them. Each city had their own patron god that resided in the Ziggurat.

The only source we have for the purpose of Ziggurats being religious is [[Herodotus]] and since the surviving Ziggurats are only a fraction of their original height due to erosion we will probably never have physical evidence of theses shrines.

Examples of Ziggurats are the [Etemananki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etemenanki), [Ziggurat of Ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggurat_of_Ur), and the white temple in [[Uruk]].
