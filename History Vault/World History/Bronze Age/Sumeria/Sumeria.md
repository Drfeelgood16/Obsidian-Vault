Sumer is the oldest civilization in [[Mesopotamia]] in modern day Iraq. The name Sumer comes from what the [[Akkadian]] people called them, sumerians instead called their land "kengir". Sumerians also referred to themselves as the "black-headed people". 

It is disputed where the Sumerian people came from. Some argue they came from the [[Indus valley]], some argue they came from the Caucasus, some even argue they came from Northern Africa. We do not know for certain where they came from.
