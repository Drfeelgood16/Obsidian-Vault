Sumer is the oldest civilization in [[Mesopotamia]] in modern day Iraq. The name Sumer comes from what the [[2. Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] people called them. Sumerians themselves called their land "kengir" which translated means "Country of the noble lords". Sumerians also referred to themselves as the "black-headed people". 

Before the [[2. Akkadian Empire|Akkadian Empire]] Sumeria consisted of several city-states with a common language and culture. Wars between city-states was very common and cities were sacked back and forth.

It is disputed where the Sumerian people came from. There are theories that they come from the [[Indus valley]], the Caucasus, or Northern Africa.
## History of Sumeria

The history of Sumer lasts between about 5000 BCE to 2000 BCE and can be divided into several periods. In chronological order these periods are:

- [[1. Pre-Akkadian Sumeria#Ubaid Period|Ubaid Period]]  5500 - 3700 BCE
- [[1. Pre-Akkadian Sumeria#Uruk Period|Uruk Period]] 4000 - 3000 BCE
- [[1. Pre-Akkadian Sumeria#Jemdet Nasr Period|Jemdet Nasr Period]] 3100 - 2900 BCE
- [[1. Pre-Akkadian Sumeria#Early Dynastic Period|Early Dynastic Period]] 2900 - 2350 BCE

## Culture
Sumerian culture was male-dominated and stratified. At the top sat the *Lugal* or *Ensi* beneath him was the free man or *lu*. Slavery was common at this time. 

Women weren't completely without rights though. They had an important role as a Temple Priestess, some of which even ruled cities. Women had the right to own property and inherited property on equal terms with their brothers. Women's powers would become more limited over time though. Polyandry was made illegal by Urukagina of Lagash.

The Sumerians had relaxed attitudes towards sex, believing for example that masturbation enhanced sexual potency for both men and women. Anal sex wasn't taboo either and was used as a form of birth control by the priestesses who were frobidden from producing offspring.

Marriage was mostly arranged by the parents and premarital sex was discouraged, though this might have been a later development.

Musically sumerians played the flute and the lyre, some of the latter have even survived to modern times.

The literature and culture of Sumeria influenced the ancient Israelites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Hittites, and even the Greeks. For example the text "Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta" has a similar narrative to the Torahs Tower of Babel parable.
## Language
The written language of Sumeria started out as hieroglyphic using ideograms. Eventually it developed into the well known *cuneiform* with the wedge shaped strokes. A well known work from Sumeria is the *Epic of Gilgamesh* written in standard Sumerian cuneiform.

The Sumerian language is a language isolate since it has no known antecedents or descendants.

## Summary
With the help of the technologies arising from the late neolithic Mesopotamia saw extreme growth. This great growth lead to urbanization and increased social stratification which in turn lead to the first leader-priests and artisans. At first the cities seemed to live peacefully either because they did or because we just don't have evidence of war. This changed during the Early Dynastic period where hegemony of city-states in Sumeria constantly changed hands which came to an end with the [[2. Akkadian Empire|Akkadian Empire]].
