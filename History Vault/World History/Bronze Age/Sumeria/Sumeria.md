Sumer is the oldest civilization in [[Mesopotamia]] in modern day Iraq. The name Sumer comes from what the [[Akkadian]] people called them, sumerians instead called their land "kengir". Sumerians also referred to themselves as the "black-headed people". 

It is disputed where the Sumerian people came from. Some argue they came from the [[Indus valley]], some argue they came from the Caucasus, some even argue they came from Northern Africa. We do not know for certain where they came from.

## History of Sumeria

The history of Sumer lasts between about 5000 BCE to 2000 BCE and can be divided into several periods.

### Ubaid period
The Ubaid period is a [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] period that lasts from about 5500 - 3700 BCE. The name comes from Tell al-'Ubaid; the largest early excavation of material from this period. The Ubaid culture has the first temples of public architecture in Mesopotamia. The Ubaid culture saw increased social stratification and was the first period to see an elite class of hereditary chieftains. The method of expansion during this era was cultural and ideological compared to the later militaristic Uruk expansions. We don't know for certain if warfare happened during this era. In modern Kuwait, which would have been far below sea in this period, archaeologists have found boats that come from this region, proving that sailing had been invented during or before the Ubaid period.
### Uruk period
The Uruk period is also known as the protoliterate period, it is on the cusp of prehistory and history. It spans from around 4000 BCE to 3000 BCE. This age saw decreasing use of pottery in favour of the new bronze material. The Uruk period can be broadly split into three phases: Old, middle, and late. The old period is the transition from the Ubaid culture into the Uruk and the initial urbanization. The middle period is an age of expansion and in the late period Uruk's influence diminished with an increase of cultural diversity. The sumerian language was first used during the late Uruk period. 

The period has got it's name from the the city of [[Uruk]], the largest city in Sumeria and the centre during this period. The reach of Uruk culture stretches as far as southeastern Anatolia and central Iran with very little to almost no influence in the Levant. Though Uruk culture was central during this period it was still just a collection of cities, it wasn't until the [[Akkadian empire]] that the entirety of Sumeria was united under one ruler.

This period sees widespread use of the pottery wheel, writing, and the invention of the state. The many developments within agricultural technology is thought to be behind the growth and proliferation of this era. These developments include better irrigation techniques, the invention of the ard (a plough pulled by an animal) that greatly lessened the burden on farmers and increased yields. The improvements during this era were so great some call this era the "Second Agricultural Revolution".

It is not only agriculture that saw great gains but pastoralism also. The wild Onager was domesticated into becoming the Donkey. The donkey became the most important beast of burden in the Near East. Previously domesticated animals like sheep and cattle who were primarily raised for their meat started being used for their wool or milk also. Increased use of sheep for their wool allowed farmers to forego the plantation of flax for linen. Wool was also easier exported than food allowing for increased trade with other civilizations for primary materials like metals.

The fast spinning pottery wheel and the improved kiln and methods like coating allowed for mass-production of pots. This made pottery more pervasive and allowed for more people to utilize it. It is debated whether the wheel was invented in this period or in the periods afterwards. There are some depictions of vehicles on what appear to be wheels but it is not certain that they are. The earliest wheels were solid blocks it took about a thousand years to develop spokes.

With these inventions Sumer had a greater surplus of food which allowed further stratifications of society. The elites during this era were the priests who acted as middle men between the normal people and the patron gods. These elites also formed the first centralized governments with archives of who owns what land or which slaves for example.  The food surplus also allowed a greater amount of increasingly specialized workers and some of the governments largest institutions even had departments devoted to a single activity. But even with these increasingly large institutions there was no planned economy. In fact there was very little accounting of what was produced and trade happened on a lower level than the institutions account for.
### Jemdet Nasr period

The Jemdet Nasr (3100 - 2900 BCE) is a small transitional period between the Uruk and Early Dynastic period and is named after the type site Tell Jemdet Nasr in Iraq. What defines the period is the distinctive painted pottery. Developments during this period mainly focuses on the [[Cuneiform]] script changing from being a pictographic language into using more simplified letters.

## Early Dynastic period

The early dynastic period (2900 - 2350 BCE) is marked by a change of power structures in that it comes from a more secular leader called a Lugal (Lu = man, Gal = great) instead of from the temples. 

This period is associated with an increase in war. This made walled cities necessary and they grew even larger because they offered protection.

The early dynastic period is famous for when [[Gilgamesh]] is said to have ruled Sumeria. Syllabic writing first occurred. 

The Early dynastic can be divided into sub-periods ED I, ED II, ED IIIa, and ED IIIb. These periods originate from the changes over time of the Abu Temple in Tell Asmar. This period marks the transition of distinguishing eras archaeologically instead the end of the Dynastic period is marked by the conquests of [[Sargon of Akkad]] and henceforth periods are distinguished by their rulers. Because of this it is not possible to distinguish if sites are ED III or [[Akkadian]] purely by archaeological means.

We have no contemporary documents from the ED I and II periods that shed light on the political developments. What we do have instead is documents show the pious acts of rulers like constructing temples. 

There are examples of hegemony and of leagues between city-states but there was no single ruling body over the entirety of Sumeria until the following [[Akkadian]] period. Texts from Shuruppak seem to confirm a [[Ki-engir]] league between the cities Umma, Lagash, [[Uruk]], Nippur, Adab, and Kish. 

The first recorded war took place in this period. This war took place in around 2700 BCE and the parties were Sumer under Enmebaragesi, the king of Kish, and [[Elam]]. The Sumerians won and "carried away as spoils the weapons of Elam". But Sumerians didn't only fight outsiders but it seems wars between sumerian cities was also common and only ended with the emergence of the Akkadian Empire.

Agriculture was extremely productive in early dynastic Sumeria. It has been postulated that in ED III three quarters of the total population in the near east resided in Sumeria.
