Sumer is the oldest civilization in [[Mesopotamia]] in modern day Iraq. The name Sumer comes from what the [[2. Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] people called them, sumerians instead called their land "kengir". Sumerians also referred to themselves as the "black-headed people". 

It is disputed where the Sumerian people came from. Some argue they came from the [[Indus valley]], some argue they came from the Caucasus, some even argue they came from Northern Africa. We do not know for certain where they came from.

## History of Sumeria

The history of Sumer lasts between about 5000 BCE to 2000 BCE and can be divided into several periods. In chronological order these periods are:

- [[1. Pre-Akkadian Sumeria#Ubaid Period|Ubaid Period]]  5500 - 3700 BCE

## Summary
With the help of the technologies arising from the late neolithic Mesopotamia saw extreme growth. This great growth lead to urbanization and increased social stratification which in turn lead to the first leader-priests and artisans. At first the cities seemed to live peacefully either because they did or because we just don't have evidence of war. This changed during the Early Dynastic period where hegemony of city-states in Sumeria constantly changed hands which came to an end with the [[2. Akkadian Empire|Akkadian Empire]].
