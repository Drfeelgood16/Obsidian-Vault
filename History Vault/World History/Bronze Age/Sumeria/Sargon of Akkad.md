Sargon of Akkad was the first ruler of the [[Akkadian Empire]]. According to the [[Sumerian King List|SKL]] he created the empire by usurping Lugalzagesi, then ruler of Sumeria, and taking the rule to Akkad. The Weidner chronicle, on the other hand, say that that he ruled directly after Ur-Zababa of Kish to whom he was cup-bearer. What both sources agree on was that he was cup-bearer to Ur-Zababa.

The spelling of his name (Sargon instead of Sarru-ukin) comes from the mention in the bible ([Isaiah 20:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2020&version=NIV;KJV)) of Sargon II (A Neo-Assyrian king). Sarru-ukin can be translated as "the king has established (stability)" or "the god has established the king". It is debated whether the name is an adopted regal name or a birth name.
