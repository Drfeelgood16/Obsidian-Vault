Sargon of Akkad was the first ruler of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] which he created by conquering the [[Sumeria|Sumerian]] city-states under the rule of Lugalzagesi.

According to the [[Sumerian King List|SKL]] he was the cup-bearer to King Ur-Zababa of Kish.

The spelling of his name (Sargon instead of Sarru-ukin) comes from the mention in the bible ([Isaiah 20:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2020&version=NIV;KJV)) of Sargon II (A Neo-Assyrian king).
