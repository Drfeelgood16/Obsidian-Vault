Sargon of Akkad was the first ruler of the [[Akkadian Empire]] and in fact created the first empire[^1]. According to the [[Sumerian King List|SKL]] he created the empire by usurping Lugalzagesi, then ruler of Sumeria, and taking the rule to Akkad. The Weidner chronicle, on the other hand, say that that he ruled as an heir to Ur-Zababa of Kish to whom he was cup-bearer. What both sources agree on was that he was cup-bearer to Ur-Zababa.

The spelling of his name (Sargon instead of Sarru-ukin) comes from the mention in the bible ([Isaiah 20:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2020&version=NIV;KJV)) of Sargon II (A Neo-Assyrian king). Sarru-ukin can be translated as "the king has established (stability)" or "the god has established the king". It is debated whether the name is an adopted regal name or a birth name.

Sargons [[Akkadian Empire]] reached the entirety of [[Sumeria]] along with [[Elam]] in the east. Sargon attempted to conquer the entire [[Fertile Crescent]] but we know that he at least came into contact with the Eblan civilization by the Mediterranean. Some sources even say Sargon conquered Cyprus.
### Sargon Epos
The Sargon Epos consists of four Babylonian text chronicling Sargons rule and conquests as a ruler. These texts are equal parts legends and chronicles, with one text even being anachronistic.

[^1] Sargon is popularly called the first ruler of an empire though it can be disputed. It all depends on what defines an empire and if you consider earlier attempts like Lugalzagesi's, Luga-Ane-Mundu's, or the [[Early Dynastic period#First Dynasty of Lagash|Lagash dynasty]] empires
