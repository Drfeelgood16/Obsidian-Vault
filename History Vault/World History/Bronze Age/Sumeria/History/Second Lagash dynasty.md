Following the death of [[Shar-kali-Sharri]] Puzur-Mama declared Lagash independent. This independence didn't come without consequences and it is believed that the Akkadians recieved tribute from Lagash after their independence. It wasn't until Ur-Ningirsu I and the fall of the [[2. Akkadian Empire|Akkadian Empire]] to the Gutians that Lagash was fully independent.

Little is known of the four rulers after Puzur-Mama except that they had years named after them. In order they are called Lu-Baba, Lugula, Kaku, and Ur-Baba.

After Ur-Baba came Gudea and with him a period marked with riches and power for Lagash. Gudea is known to have conducted some military operations in the east. He was also prodigious restorer of temples. The most notable object from this period for historians is the Gudea Cylinder which contains the longest known text in Sumerian. He was succeded by his son Ur-Ningirsu and Ur-Gar after him, both of whom we know little about.

The last ruler of the Second Dynasty is Nam-Mahani who is mainly known for being defeated by Ur-Nammu of Ur.
