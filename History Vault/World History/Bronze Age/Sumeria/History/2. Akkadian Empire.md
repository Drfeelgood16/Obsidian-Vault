The Akkadian empire is often proclaimed as the first ancient empire of Mesopotamia but there are arguably earlier [[Sumeria|Sumerian]] empires like the [[1. Pre-Akkadian Sumeria#Empire of Lugal-Ane-mundu of Adab|Empire of Lugal-Ane-mundu of Adab]] and the [[1. Pre-Akkadian Sumeria#First Dynasty of Lagash|Lagash Dynasty]]. Written sources from this empire are few mainly because the capital of Akkad has yet to be discovered.

The Akkadian empire was created when [[Sargon of Akkad]] defeated and captured Lugalzagesi and annexed the Sumerian empire as his own. His dynasty ruled [[Sumeria]] for almost 200 years between 2334-2154 BCE and is followed by a dark age under Gutian control.

Akkad is mentioned in the bible in [Genesis 10:10-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+10%3A10-12&version=NIV;KJV) as a part of the kingdom of Nimrod. We have no evidence of a Nimrod ever existing but a theories postulate that he might be [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] or his grandson Naram-Sin.

There was widespread bilingualism between Sumerian and Akkadian in the Akkadian Empire and the languages borrowed much from each other. Akkadian eventually replaced Sumerian but the Sumerian language was still used as a religious and scientific language similar how latin is used.
### Sargonic Dynasty
The first five rulers of Akkad all came from the Sargonic dynasty. 
- The first of which is [[Sargon of Akkad]] himself. He conquered Sumeria and Elam and campaigned as far away as the Mediterranean.
- [[Rimush]] spent his nine years in power quashing the revolts that occurred after Sargons death accruing a great amount of Sumerians doing so. He died according to legend by being poisoned by someone from his court..
- [[Manishtushu]] campaigned in the Persian gulf and was also assassinated like his brother Rimush.
- [[Naram-Sin]] campaigned in Elam and Syria and consolidated power in [[Sumeria]] by appointing family members as the leaders of sumerian city-states. After the great revolt at the start of his reign he deified himself and his father and grandfather.
- [[Shar-Kali-Sharri]] lead a relatively peaceful reign and further consolidated his power within Sumeria. His death left a great power vacuum leading to anarchy within the empire.

## Collapse
At the end of [[Shar-Kali-Sharri]]'s rule the Akkadian empire was already unraveling with rulers like Puzur-Mama taking sole control of Lagash and starting the second Lagash dynasty. Eventually after [[Shar-Kali-Sharri]]'s death the Gutians invaded and took control of much of the empire. 
## Gutian rule
The Gutians are the first example of what we now considered barbarians in modern culture. It is said that their rule was terrible because they let out all the farm animals to roam free in Mesopotamia. The price of grain is said to have sky-rocketed.

After the Gutian invasion there were attempts made to restore the Akkadian empire under the two rulers Dudu and Shu-turul.
## Government
The Akkadian government became a standard for later Mesopotamian governments. In this government there was a centralized ruler of "King of the universe" usually in Akkad. Every sumerian city kept it's ensi to be a provinicial governor under this central ruler. [[Naram-Sin]] raised the title of the central ruler from king to god. Nepotism was also used to consolidate power by appointing daughters as head-priestesses or by marrying them off to rulers while sons were given rule over city-states.

## Economy
The economy of Akkad is the same as the Sumerians before him. It is based mostly on agriculture, more precisely the cultivation of barley. The rainfall during this era appears to be as sparse as it is currently so agriculture was dependent mostly on irrigation. Irrigation ditches required constant maintenance in Mesopotamia since flooding wasn't as reliable as the Nile. Farmers were recruited for this work during periods of food-shortages providing a sort of unemployment-relief.

Pastoral nomadic Amorites would be allowed to graze these fields after harvest, for which they would pay a tax in wools, meat, milk, and cheese.
#### Foreign trade
As a result of Akkad having a surplus of agricultural products but very few other natural resources trade with neighbouring civilizations was common and followed the Sumerians successfully doing it before the Akkadians.
