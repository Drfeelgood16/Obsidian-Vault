The early dynastic period (2900 - 2350 BCE) is marked by a change of power structures in that it comes from a more secular leader called a Lugal (Lu = man, Gal = great) instead of from the temples. Some cities were still ruled by a more religious "En" or "Ensi".

This period is associated with an increase in war. This made walled cities necessary and walled cities grew even larger because they offered protection.

The early dynastic period is famous for when [[Gilgamesh]] is said to have ruled Sumeria. Syllabic writing first occurred. 

The Early dynastic can be divided into sub-periods ED I, ED II, ED IIIa, and ED IIIb. These periods originate from the changes over time of the Abu Temple in Tell Asmar. This period marks the end of distinguishing eras archaeologically we instead mark the end of periods by their rulers. The end of the Dynastic period is, for example, marked by the conquests of [[Sargon of Akkad]] which lead in to the [[Akkadian]] period. Because of this it is not possible to distinguish if sites are ED III or [[Akkadian]] purely by archaeological means.

We have no contemporary documents from the ED I and II periods that shed light on most of the political developments. What we do have instead is many documents that show the pious acts of rulers like constructing temples. It is likely that the rule of a city was split between its lugal and a council of elders who always advised the lugal before every action.

There are examples of hegemony and of leagues between city-states but there was no single ruling body over the entirety of Sumeria until the following [[Akkadian]] period. Texts from Shuruppak seem to confirm a [[Ki-engir]] league between the cities Umma, Lagash, [[Uruk]], Nippur, Adab, and Kish.

The first recorded war took place in this period. This war took place in around 2700 BCE and the parties were Sumer under Enmebaragesi, the king of Kish, and [[Elam]]. The Sumerians won and "carried away as spoils the weapons of Elam". But Sumerians didn't only fight outsiders but it seems wars between sumerian cities was also common and only ended with the emergence of the Akkadian Empire.

Agriculture was extremely productive in early dynastic Sumeria. It has been postulated that in ED III three quarters of the total population in the near east resided in Sumeria. This extreme productiveness lead to vastly increased trade. This trade was also necessary for the Sumerians because they lacked natural resources like copper, tin, gold, and wood which was essential for a prospering empire and to conduct warfare. So they imported gold from [[Egypt]] or [[Nubia]], copper from Oman, Tin from iran, and wood from Lebanon and exported their excesses of food, wool, and other agricultural and pastoral products.

The city that benefited most from this trade was the city of Ur. It sat at the top of the Persian gulf by the mouth of the Euphrates. This ideal location allowed easy travel by waters from the west and east. The Euphrates allowed trade from the Levant and Egypt in the west while the Persian gulf allowed trade from India in the east. We know of Urs great wealth through their cemeteries which had an abundance of expensive objects compared to cemeteries in other Sumerian cities. Resin from as far as Mozambique has been found in a tomb in Ur.

The earliest known legal code and legal reform in recorded history is the Code of Uru-ka-gina of Lagash. The code itself has sadly not survived but we do know it existed through secondary sources. The code was a reformation of the laws of the corrupt previous king and was an attempt to reach higher levels of equality and freedom. For example it decreed that the rich must use silver when purchasing from the poor and the rich man is not allowed to force the poor man to sell his wares if he does not want to. It also outlawed polyandry with the punishment being stoning with rocks upon which the crime was written.

Metalworking was quite intricate especially so if you take into account that all the metals had to be imported.

## Dynasties
As the name implies the Early dynastic period was lead by several dynasties originating from different cities in Sumeria.

#### First dynasty of Kish
The earliest known king of [[Kish]] is Etana. During this dynasty lugal Enmebaragesi fought a war and won against the [Elamites](Elam)
