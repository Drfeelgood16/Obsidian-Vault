The Akkadian empire is often proclaimed as the first ancient empire of Mesopotamia but there are arguably earlier [[Sumeria|Sumerian]] empires like the [[Early Dynastic period#Empire of Lugal-Ane-mundu of Adab|Empire of Lugal-Ane-mundu of Adab]] and the [[Early Dynastic period#First Dynasty of Lagash|Lagash Dynasty]]. Written sources from this empire are few mainly because the capital of Akkad has yet to be discovered.
