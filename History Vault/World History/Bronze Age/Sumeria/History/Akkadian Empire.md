The Akkadian empire is often proclaimed as the first ancient empire of Mesopotamia but there are arguably earlier [[Sumeria|Sumerian]] empires like the [[Early Dynastic period#Empire of Lugal-Ane-mundu of Adab|Empire of Lugal-Ane-mundu of Adab]] and the [[Early Dynastic period#First Dynasty of Lagash|Lagash Dynasty]]. Written sources from this empire are few mainly because the capital of Akkad has yet to be discovered.

The Akkadian empire was created when [[Sargon of Akkad]] defeated and captured Lugalzagesi and annexed the Sumerian empire as his own. His dynasty ruled [[Sumeria]] for almost 200 years between 2334-2154 BCE and is followed by a dark age under Gutian control.

The rulers of Akkad all came from the family of [[Sargon of Akkad]].

Akkad is mentioned in the bible in [Genesis 10:10-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+10%3A10-12&version=NIV;KJV) as a part of the kingdom of Nimrod. We have no evidence of a Nimrod ever existing but a theories postulate that he might be [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] or his grandson Naram-Sin.
