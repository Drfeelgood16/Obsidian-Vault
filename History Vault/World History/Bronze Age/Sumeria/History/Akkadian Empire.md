The Akkadian empire is often proclaimed as the first ancient empire of Mesopotamia but there are arguably earlier [[Sumeria|Sumerian]] empires like the [[Early Dynastic period#Empire of Lugal-Ane-mundu of Adab|Empire of Lugal-Ane-mundu of Adab]] and the [[Early Dynastic period#First Dynasty of Lagash|Lagash Dynasty]]. Written sources from this empire are few mainly because the capital of Akkad has yet to be discovered.

The Akkadian empire was created when [[Sargon of Akkad]] defeated and captured Lugalzagesi and annexed the Sumerian empire as his own. His dynasty ruled [[Sumeria]] for almost 200 years between 2334-2154 BCE and is followed by a dark age under Gutian control.

Akkad is mentioned in the bible in [Genesis 10:10-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+10%3A10-12&version=NIV;KJV) as a part of the kingdom of Nimrod. We have no evidence of a Nimrod ever existing but a theories postulate that he might be [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] or his grandson Naram-Sin.
### Sargonic Dynasty
The first five rulers of Akkad all came from the Sargonic dynasty. 
- The first of which is [[Sargon of Akkad]] himself. He conquered Sumeria and Elam and campaigned as far away as the Mediterranean.
- [[Rimush]] spent his nine years in power quashing the revolts that occurred after Sargons death accruing a great amount of Sumerians doing so. He died according to legend by being poisoned by someone from his court..
- [[Manishtushu]] campaigned in the Persian gulf and was also assassinated like his brother Rimush.
- [[Naram-Sin]] campaigned in Elam and Syria and consolidated power in [[Sumeria]] by appointing family members as the leaders of sumerian city-states. After the great revolt at the start of his reign he deified himself and his father and grandfather.
- [[Shar-Kali-Sharri]] lead a relatively peaceful reign and further consolidated his power within Sumeria. His death left a great power vacuum leading to anarchy within the empire.

## Collapse
At the end of [[Shar-Kali-Sharri]]'s rule the Akkadian empire was already unraveling with rulers like Puzer-Mama taking sole control of Lagash and starting the second Lagash dynasty. Eventually after [[Shar-Kali-Sharri]]'s death the Gutians invaded and took control of much of the empire. 
## Gutian rule
 
The Gutians are the first example of what we now considered barbarians in modern culture. It is said that their rule was terrible because they let out all the farm animals to roam free in Mesopotamia. The price of grain is said to have sky-rocketed.

## Government
The Akkadian government became a standard for later Mesopotamian governments. In this government there was a centralized ruler of "King of the universe" usually in Akkad. Every sumerian city kept it's ensi to be a provinicial governor under this central ruler. [[Naram-Sin]] raised the title of the central ruler from king to god. Nepotism was also used to consolidate power by appointing daughters as head-priestesses or by marrying them off to rulers while sons were given rule over city-states.
