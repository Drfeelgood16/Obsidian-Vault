Uruk, today known as Warka, is a central city in the ancient civilization of [[Sumer|Sumeria]]. It lies in [[Mesopotamia]] in modern Iraq a bit southwest of the ancient [[Euphrates]]. Uruk has given the name for the eponymous [[Sumer#Uruk period|Uruk period]] in [[Bronze Age]] Sumeria. By the end of the Uruk period 40 000 citizens might have been living in Uruk and up to 90 000 in the surrounding area.

Uruk was founded by Enmerkar according to the [[Sumerian King List]]. 

Uruk was formed when two smaller [[Sumer#Ubaid period|Ubaid]] settlements merged. The temples districts at the core of each settlement became the Eanna District and the Anu District. Each dedicated to the gods [[Inanna]] and [[Anu]] respectively.

## Anu District

The Anu district consists of a single terrace, the Anu [[Ziggurat]]

Canals ran through the city that has been called "Venice of the desert" that connected trade to the [[Euphrates]].

Eanna is confusingly also known as a temple in Uruk housing the gods [[Inanna]] and [[Anu]].
