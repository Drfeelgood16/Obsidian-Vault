Uruk, today known as Warka, is a central city in the ancient civilization of [[Sumer|Sumeria]]. It lies in [[Mesopotamia]] in modern Iraq a bit southwest of the ancient [[Euphrates]]. Uruk has given the name for the eponymous [[Sumer#Uruk period|Uruk period]] in [[Bronze Age]] Sumeria. By the end of the Uruk period 40 000 citizens might have been living in Uruk and up to 90 000 in the surrounding area.

Uruk was founded by Enmerkar according to the [[Sumerian King List]]. 

Uruk was formed when two smaller [[Sumer#Ubaid period|Ubaid]] settlements merged. The temples districts at the core of each settlement became the Eanna District and the Anu District. Each dedicated to the gods [[Inanna]] and [[Anu]] respectively.

There were extensive canals that ran through the city to connect trade to the [[Euphrates]]. Because of these canals Uruk has been called "Venice of the desert".

About 400 Proto-[[Cuneiform]] tablets have been found in Uruk which is some the earliest recorded writing ever found. A tablet containing the [[Sumerian King List]] was also found and deciphered here along with tablets from the [[Babylon|Babylonian]] and [[Selecuid]] empires.

The [Uruk Trough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk_Trough) and the [Warka Vase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warka_Vase), the earliest forms of narrative art has been found in Uruk. Both of these artifacts along with the [Mask of Warka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_of_Warka) are connected to the goddess Inanna.
## Anu District

The Anu district consists of a single terrace, the Anu [[Ziggurat]] on which the white temple dedicated to the god Anu stood. The White Temple gets its name from the white plates that covered its walls. Next to the Ziggurat there was a stone building with a Labyrinthine plan.

## Eanna District

The Eanna District went through several re-buildings often called periods where the previous temples were destroyed and rebuilt. There are VI Eanna periods where Eanna VI is the oldest.

Eannas first building was the Stone-cone Temple (Mosaic Temple), named after the mosaic of colored stone cones in the brick facade. It was built over an earlier [[Sumer#Ubaid period|Ubaid]] temple in Eanna VI and was later "destroyed by force" and built over by succeeding buildings.

About 100 m east of the Stone-cone Temple the Limestone Temple was built during the Eanna V period[[^1]]. It unlike other Ubaid architecture was built using stone instead of mud-bricks. We do not know if it was just the foundation that was made of stone or if it was the entire building. This temple is presumably the first Inannan temple. This temple was also covered in mosaics similar to the Stone-cone Temple.

Between these temples there were assorted buildings, courts, and walls built during the Eanna IVb period. Among them is the Riemchen building  that featured a memorial fire for the then destroyed Stone-cone Temple it was built over. Also the Cone-Mosaic Temple, what is thought to be the greatest example of the Stone-cone mosaic.

The buildings in the Eanna IVb period were all ritually destroyed to facilitate the construction of a terrace with a new set of buildings (C, D, M, Great Hall, and Pillar Hall). In the place of the Limestone Temple the Red Temple was built and the Great Court complete with a small aqueduct was built. These buildings were all destroyed for unclear reasons somewhere in the Eanna III period.

In period III Eanna saw very different architecture compared to earlier periods. Instead of great temples there were baths near the Great Courtyard. We know that the temple of Inanna still existed during this time but we do not know where. Because of the increased turmoil during this period the architecture is increasingly fortress-like.

## Downfall of Uruk

Uruk was eventually annexed by the [[Akkadian Empire]] and went into decline. Uruk enjoyed a revival during the later Neo-Sumerian period under the sovereignty of Ur which saw a new temple for Inanna. Uruk continued to see ups when it was under sovereignty of other empires and declines when these empires ended until it's eventual decline caused by the Euphrates diverging.

[^1] In the Wikipedia page it says Uruk V period but [this paper](https://sci-hub.zidianzhan.net/10.2307/504076) says "A still earlier level, closely related to IV, was labelled level V. The main building of that level, the so-called "Limestone (Kalkstein) temple" was still in existence in level IV" where it seem to use level and Eannan Period interchangeably.
