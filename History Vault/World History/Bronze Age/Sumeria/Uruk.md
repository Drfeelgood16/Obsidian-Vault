Uruk, today known as Warka, is a central city in the ancient civilization of [[Sumer|Sumeria]]. It lies in [[Mesopotamia]] in modern Iraq a bit southwest of the ancient [[Euphrates]]. Uruk has given the name for the eponymous [[Sumer#Uruk period|Uruk period]] in [[Bronze Age]] Sumeria. By the end of the Uruk period 40 000 citizens might have been living in Uruk and up to 90 000 in the surrounding area.

Uruk was founded by Enmerkar according to the [[Sumerian King List]]. 

Uruk was formed when two smaller [[Sumer#Ubaid period|Ubaid]] settlements merged. The temples districts at the core of each settlement became the Eanna District and the Anu District. Each dedicated to the gods [[Inanna]] and [[Anu]] respectively.

There were extensive canals that ran through the city to connect trade to the [[Euphrates]]. Because of these canals Uruk has been called "Venice of the desert".
## Anu District

The Anu district consists of a single terrace, the Anu [[Ziggurat]] on which the white temple dedicated to the god Anu stood.

## Eanna District

The Eanna District went through several re-buildings often called periods where the previous temples were destroyed and rebuilt. There are VI Eanna periods where Eanna VI is the oldest.

Eannas first building was the Stone-cone Temple (Mosaic Temple), named after the mosaic of colored stone cones in the brick facade. It was built over an earlier [[Sumer#Ubaid period|Ubaid]] temple in Eanna VI and was later "destroyed by force" and built over by succeeding buildings.

About 100 m east of the Stone-cone Temple the Limestone Temple was later built. It unlike other Ubaid architecture was built using stone instead of mud-bricks. We do not know if it was just the foundation that was made of stone or if it was the entire building. This temple is presumably the first Inannan temple. This temple was also covered in mosaics similar to the Stone-cone Temple.

Between these temples there were assorted buildings, courts, and walls. Among them is the Riemchen building that featured a memorial fire for the then destroyed Stone-cone Temple it was built in the place of.
