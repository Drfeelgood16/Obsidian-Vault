The Sumerian King List is a literary work from the [[Ur III]] period or later listing [Sumerian](Sumeria.md) cities and their rulers along with the length of their rule. It was most likely created as a piece of propaganda to legitimize the rule of an emperor but we don't know which. It used to be an invaluable source for scholars researching the early dynasty of Sumeria but the reasons behind it's creation along with some irregularities make it an unreliable source.
