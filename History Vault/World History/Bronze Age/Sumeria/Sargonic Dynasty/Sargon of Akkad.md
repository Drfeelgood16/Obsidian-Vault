Sargon of Akkad was the first ruler of the [[Akkadian Empire]] and in fact created the first empire[^1]. According to the [[Sumerian King List|SKL]] he created the empire by usurping Lugalzagesi, then ruler of Sumeria, and taking the rule to Akkad. The Weidner chronicle, on the other hand, say that that he ruled as an heir to Ur-Zababa of Kish to whom he was cup-bearer. What both sources agree on was that he was cup-bearer to Ur-Zababa.

The story of Sargons birth and upbringing either is a legend or became a legend. The story goes as such: Sargon was born as an illegitimate son to a priestess. After his birth his mother set him in a basket and cast him into the Euphrates which carried him to Akkad. In Akkad the gardener of Ur-Zababa, Akki, raised Sargon. He gained the favour of [[Inanna|Ishtar]] and ruled Sumeria for an unknown amount of years because of a lacuna.

Readers of the bible might recognize this myth as part of the Moses myth. It is in fact very similar and probably have the same origin. Hindus might also recognize it from the myth of Karna. Nimrod from the old testament might also be a combination of Sargon and his grandson Naram-Sin.

The spelling of his name (Sargon instead of Sarru-ukin) comes from the mention in the bible ([Isaiah 20:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2020&version=NIV;KJV)) of Sargon II (A Neo-Assyrian king). Sarru-ukin can be translated as "the king has established (stability)" or "the god has established the king". It is debated whether the name is an adopted regal name or a birth name.

Sargons [[Akkadian Empire]] reached the entirety of [[Sumeria]] along with [[Elam]] in the east. Sargon attempted to conquer the entire [[Fertile Crescent]] but we know that he at least came into contact with the Eblan civilization by the Mediterranean. Some sources even say Sargon conquered Cyprus.

Sargon had great reverence for the Sumerian gods Inanna, Zababa, Anu, Enlil, and Nanna.
### Family
Sargons family includes a wife, Queen Tashlultum, who we only know of from a vase shard. She is considered the mother of Sargons children because there exist no contrary evidence. Sargon and Tashlulutum had 5 children: Rimush who reigned after him, Manishtushu who reigned after Rimush and who is the father of Naram-Sin, [[Enheduanna]] his only daughter who was high priestess of the moon god Nanna in Ur, lastly there are two other sons who we only know the names of: Shu-Enlil and Ilaba'is-takal.

### Sargon Epos
The Sargon Epos consists of four Babylonian text chronicling Sargons rule and conquests as a ruler. These texts are equal parts legends and chronicles, with one text even being anachronistic. His rule is also the first in a long period of Semitic rule in Mesopotamia.

### Legacy
Sargon was regarded as a model for later Mesopotamian kings. The Assyrian and Babylonian kings regarded themselves as heirs of Sargons empire. Two Assyrian kings even named themselves after Sargon of Akkad.

[^1] Sargon is popularly called the first ruler of an empire though it can be disputed. It all depends on what defines an empire and if you consider earlier attempts like Lugalzagesi's, Luga-Ane-Mundu's, or the [[Early Dynastic period#First Dynasty of Lagash|Lagash dynasty]] empires
