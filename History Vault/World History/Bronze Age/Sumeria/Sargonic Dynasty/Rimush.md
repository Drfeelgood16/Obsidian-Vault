Rimush was the second king of the [[2. Akkadian Empire]], ruling after his father: [[Sargon of Akkad]]. He was succeeded by his brother [[Manishtushu]] when he died, according to legend, by assassination after 9 years of rule.

Most of his reign was taken up by consolidating power in his vast empire. As per his own inscriptions he had to reconquer several [[Sumeria|Sumerian]] cities. His way of consolidating power was by mass slaughter and destruction of several Sumerian city-states.[^P1]

There is also evidence of a campaign into [[Elam]] and it's neighbour to the east, Marhashi.
