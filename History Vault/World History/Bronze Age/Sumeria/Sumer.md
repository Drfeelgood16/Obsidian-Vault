Sumer is the oldest civilization in [[Mesopotamia]]. The name Sumer comes from what the [[Akkadian]] people called them, sumerians instead called their land "kengir". Sumerians also referred to themselves as the "black-headed people" 

It is disputed where the Sumerian people came from. Some argue they came from the [[Indus valley]], some argue they came from the Caucasus, some even argue they came from Northern Africa. We do not know for certain where they came from.

## History of Sumer

The history of Sumer lasts between about 5000 BCE to 2000 BCE and can be divided into several periods.

### Ubaid period
The Ubaid period is a [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] period that lasts from about 5500 - 3700 BCE. The name comes from Tell al-'Ubaid; the largest early excavation of material from this period. The Ubaid culture has the first temples of public architecture in Mesopotamia. The Ubaid culture saw increased social stratification and was the first period to see an elite class of hereditary chieftains. The method of expansion during this era was cultural and ideological compared to the later militaristic Uruk expansions. We don't know for certain if warfare happened during this era. In modern Kuwait, which would have been far below sea in this period, archaeologists have found boats that come from this region, proving that sailing had been invented during or before the Ubaid period.
### Uruk period
The Uruk period is also known as the protoliterate period, it is on the cusp of prehistory and history. It spans from around 4000 BCE to 3000 BCE. This age saw decreasing use of pottery in favour of the new bronze material. The Uruk period can be broadly split into three phases: Old, middle, and late. The old period is the transition from the Ubaid culture into the Uruk and the initial urbanization. The middle period is an age of expansion and in the late period Uruk's influence diminished with an increase of cultural diversity. The sumerian language was first used during the late Uruk period. 

The period has got it's name from the the city of [[Uruk]], the largest city in Sumeria and the centre during this period. The reach of Uruk culture stretches as far as southeastern Anatolia and central Iran with very little to almost no influence in the Levant.

This period sees widespread use of the pottery wheel, writing, and the invention of the state. The many developments within agricultural technology is thought to be behind the growth and proliferation of this era. These developments include better irrigation techniques, the invention of the ard (a plough pulled by an animal) that greatly lessened the burden on farmers and increased yields. The improvements during this era were so great some call this era the "Second Agricultural Revolution".

It is not only agriculture that saw great gains but pastoralism also. The wild Onager was domesticated into becoming the Donkey. The donkey became the most important beast of burden in the Near East. Previously domesticated animals like sheep and cattle who were primarily raised for their meat started being used for their wool or milk also. Increased use of sheep for their wool allowed farmers to forego the plantation of flax for linen. Wool was also easier exported than food allowing for increased trade with other civilizations for primary materials like metals.

The fast spinning pottery wheel and the improved kiln and methods like coating allowed for mass-production of pots. This made pottery more pervasive and allowed for more people to utilize it. It is debated whether the wheel was invented in this period or in the periods afterwards. There are some depictions of vehicles on what appear to be wheels but it is not certain that they are. The earliest wheels were solid blocks it took about a thousand years to develop spokes.

With these inventions Sumer had a greater surplus of food which allowed further stratifications of society. The elites during this era were the priests who acted as middle men between the normal people and the patron gods. These elites also formed the first centralized governments with archives of who owns what land or which slaves for example.  The food surplus also allowed a greater amount of increasingly specialized workers and some of the governments largest institutions even had departments devoted to a single activity. But even with these increasingly large institutions there was no planned economy. In fact there was very little accounting of what was produced and trade happened on a lower level than the institutions account for.
### Jemdet Nasr period

The Jemdet Nasr is a small transitional period between the Uruk and Early Dynastic period and is named after the type site Tell Jemdet Nasr in Iraq. What defines the period is the distinctive painted pottery. Developments during this period mainly focuses on the [[Cuneiform]] script changing from being a pictographic language into using more simplified letters.

## Early Dynastic period

The early dynastic period is famous for when Gilgamesh is said to have ruled Sumeria. Syllabic writing first occured.
