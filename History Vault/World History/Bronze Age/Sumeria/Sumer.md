Sumer is the oldest civilization in [[Mesopotamia]]. The name Sumer comes from what the [[Akkadian]] people called them, sumerians instead called their land "kengir". Sumerians also referred to themselves as the "black-headed people" 

It is disputed where the Sumerian people came from. Some argue they came from the [[Indus valley]], some argue they came from the Caucasus, some even argue they came from Northern Africa. We do not know for certain where they came from.

## History of Sumer

The history of Sumer lasts between about 5000 BCE to 2000 BCE and can be divided into several periods.

### Ubaid period
The Ubaid period is a [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] period that lasts from about 5500 - 3700 BCE. The name comes from Tell al-'Ubaid; the largest early excavation of material from this period. The Ubaid culture has the first temples of public architecture in Mesopotamia. The earliest evidence of sailing originates from the late Ubaid. The Ubaid culture saw increased social stratification and was the first period to see an elite class of hereditary chieftains. The method of expansion during this era was cultural and ideological compared to the later militaristic Uruk expansions. We don't know for certain if warfare happened during this era.
### Uruk period
The Uruk period is also known as the protoliterate period, it is on the cusp of prehistory and history. It spans from around 4000 BCE to 3000 BCE. This age saw decreasing use of pottery in favour of the new bronze material. The Uruk period can be broadly split into three phases: Old, middle, and late. The old period is the transition from the Ubaid culture into the Uruk and the initial urbanization. The middle period is an age of expansion and in the late period Uruk's influence diminished with an increase of cultural diversity. The sumerian language was first used during the late Uruk period. 

This period sees widespread use of the pottery wheel, writing, and the invention of the state. The many delevopments within agricultural technology is thought to be behind the growth and proliferation of this era. These developments include better irrigation techniques, the invention of the ard (a plough pulled by an animal) that greatly lessened the burden on farmers and increased yields. The improvements during this era were so great some call this era the "Second Agricultural Revolution".

It is not only agriculture that saw great gains but pastoralism also. The wild Onager was domesticated into becoming the Donkey. The donkey became the most important beast of burden in the Near East. Previously domesticated animals like sheep and cattle who were primarily raised for their meat started being used for their wool or milk also. Increased use of sheep for their wool allowed farmers to forego the plantation of flax for linen. Wool was also easier exported than food allowing for increased trade with other civilizations for primary materials like metals.

The pottery wheel and the improved kiln and methods like coating allowed for mass-production of pots. This made pottery more pervasive and allowed for more people to utilize it.

The period has got it's name from the the city of [[Uruk]], the largest city in Sumeria and the centre during this period. The reach of Uruk culture stretches as far as southeastern Anatolia and central Iran with very little to almost no influence in the Levant.

Most scholars agree that there was a period of Uruk Expansionism. But it is disputed if this was a political campaign or if it was a result of cultural Uruks moving out and creating trading posts and farming neighbouring lands. The Urukians did create some colonies outside Lower Mesopotamia some of which can be considered a form of economic imperialism by settling in central locations to control trade.
### Jemdet Nasr period
