The royal titulary is the standard naming conventions of Pharaohs in Ancient Egypt. The system is also referred to as "the great five names." In short, the Pharaohs were given five names that symbolized power, might, and could also act as a mission statement.
# Horus Name **ìÖÉìäÅ**
The Horus name is the oldest of the five names reaching as far back as pre-dynastic Egypt to the Naqada II period at about 3400 BC. The Horus name is usually represented by a [[Serekh]] with the Pharaohs name inside it with a god, usually Horus hence the name, sitting on top of it. Modern Egyptologists prefer the term "serekh name" since some Pharaohs placed other deities like [[Set]] on top instead of the falcon representing Horus.
## Symbology
The Horus name is thought to represent the commonly held belief that the Pharaoh was an earthly manifestation of the god Horus. The eagle could also represent omnipresence and a vast power.

# Nebty Name ![[Nebty.png]]
The Nebty name or "Two-Ladies name" is the second oldest royal title first being used by the pharaoh Semerkhet of the First Dynasty. The Nebty name is represented by two glyphs next to each other, the first glyph is a griffon vultures sitting on a basket, the second is a cobra sitting on a basket. Nebty (nbtj) is a contraction of the two goddesses Nekhbet and Wadjet of whom the name and symbols symbolizes. The name is also thought to represent a unified Egypt and as a royal title the pharaoh wished to present themselves as the ruler of it.

# Horus of Gold ![[Horus of Gold.png]]
The Horus of Gold is represented by a Horus falcon perched above or beside the hieroglyph for gold. The Horus of Gold sees its first use in the Fourth Dynasty. The Horus of Gold is thought to symbolize the triumph of Horus over his uncle Set.

# Prenomen ![[Prenomen.png]]
The prenomen, also known as the [[Cartouche]] name or throne name, is represented by a sedge and bee *nswt-bjtj* above the symbol of bread. It is thought to symbolize the dual kingship of Upper (sedge) and Lower (bee) Egypt. There are also several possible interpretation for what the sedge and bee are supposed to represent.
## Use
During the first three dynasties the prenomen was either depicted alone or, early on, with the Nebty name. From the end of the third dynasty and onward the prenomen was encircled by the [[Cartouche]].

The *nswt-bjtj* group has other uses than as a denotation of a royal name. They could also represent the kings executive officials. The symbols could also be used to denote the personal property of the pharaoh, or to signify a royal decree.

The sedge symbol, *nswt*, could also be used to denote the relationships within the royal family. In this context *nswt* signifies family members with a direct blood link with the Pharaoh. These titles became honorific later in Ancient Egypt so from the Fifth Dynasty onward high officials or courtiers were called sons or daughters of the pharaoh. It could also mean "favorite of the king" from as far back as the First Dynasty.

The *bjt* crest also expressed royal authority, the only officials allowed to touch the royal personal possessions wore the *bjt* crest.

Late into the history of Ancient Egypt both the nomen and prenomen was used interchangeably which caused some confusion for Egyptologists.
# Nomen ![[Nomen.png]]
The nomen, or *Sa-R√™* was first introduced in combination with the prenomen until Neferirkare Kakai separated them in the Fifth Dynasty. *Sa-R√™* literally means "Son of Ra" and was written with the sign of a sun disc above a goose, usually inside a [[Cartouche]]. Later on it started being placed before the cartouche. The name or nomen itself was placed inside the cartouche.
