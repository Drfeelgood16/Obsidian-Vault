# History

## Predynastic or Prehistoric Egypt
The earliest finds from Egypt dates as far back as the Paleolithic where some Acheulean tools have been found. Evidence of settlers exist as far back as the Mesolithic period but most settlements were temporary. It wasn't until the continued expansion of the desert and with the advent of agriculture in the Neolithic period that people settled down along the Nile. Eventually these settlements unified into two different nations, one by the Nile Delta called "Lower Egypt" and one by the towns of the upper Nile river called "Upper Egypt."

It is disputed where this period ends and the Early Dynastic begins.

The majority of archaeological finds are from [[Upper Egypt]] because the civilizations in the [[Nile]] delta have been buried under the silt that the Nile carries.
# Early Dynastic Period (3150 - 2686 BC)
The two nations warred often and during the reign of King Narmer of upper Egypt he defeated his enemies and united Egypt into one Kingdom. This unification marks the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period. Narmer is often depicted wearing a double crown with a lotus flower representing Upper Egypt and the papyrus reed representing Lower Egypt.
