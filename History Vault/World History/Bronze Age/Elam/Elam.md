Elam (also known as Susiana by the Greeks) is the oldest known civilization in the territory of present-day Iran. The civilization was centered in the city of Susa in the Khuzetan lowlands. We mainly know Elam through their conflicts with [[Sumeria]] and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]. Elam along with the Amorites were the ones that sacked Ur and ended the [[Post-Akkadian Sumeria#Third Dynasty of Ur / Ur III / Neo-Sumerian Empire|Neo-Sumerian Empire]] and by doing so ending Sumerian hegemony in Mesopotamia for good. Elam was succeeded by the Persian Achaemenid dynasty in which Elam's culture played a central role. 

# Geography
Elam is positioned well both strategically and economically. The Iranian Plateau provides protection against invasion from the north and a wealth of ores. Elam was also the closest of two routes to the Indus civilization to the east making it a hub for trade and tolls.
# History
Elam was urbanized along with [[Sumeria]] during the [[Chalcolithic]] period at around 3000 BCE. The history of Elam can be divided into five periods.
## Proto-Elamite period
The Proto-Elamite period, also known as Susa II, stretches from 3100 - 2700 BC. In this period Elam has yet to be unified under one empire. That didn't happen until Old Elamite Period. Instead, what was to become Elam consisted of several separate city-states.

The texts from this period is written in Proto-Elamite script, an ideographic script similar to the Proto-Cuneiform. Proto-Elamite remains majority undeciphered though we still know the content of some texts through the symbolic meanings.

## Old Elamite Period
### Awan Dynasty (2700 - 2150 BC)
The Awan dynasty, the first known dynasty of Elam brings in the Old Elamite Period, it is partly contemporary with [[Sargon of Akkad]] who killed the emperor *Luh-ishan* and made Susa a subject. When the [[Akkadian Empire]] collapsed the last Awan king, *Kutik-Inshushunak*, declared Elam independent. He then conquered Susa and Anshan and achieved political unity. But after his reign Elam was overrun by the Gutians for a century until the Sumerians conquered Susa under Shulgi of the Neo-Sumerian Empire.
### Shimashki dynasty (2050 - 1970 BC)
When Susa and much of the plains was under Sumerian control the Shimashki dynasty in the mountains east of Susa lead Elam. This period was filled with strife between the Sumerians, Gutians, and Elamites. Eventually the Elamites allied with the people of Susa surrounded and sacked the city of Ur ending Sumeria for good. They were eventually driven out by the Akkadians from Isin.
### Sukkulmah dynasty (1970-1770 BC)
Susa was in this period under constant attack from other Mesopotamian states but it remained in the control of Elam. This dynasty would have great influence in the region before the establishment of the Babylonian Empire who would kick them out of Mesopotamia. They would still have great political influence when Babylon ruled Mesopotamia.

## Middle Elamite Period (1500 - 1100 BC)
The middle period begins with the rise of the Anshanite dynasty around 1500 BC and featured an increasing use of the Elamite language instead of the then wide-spread Akkadian. Elam fought and were temporarily occupied by their new neighbors, the Kassites, who had taken over Babylonia after its fall. When the Kassites eventually waned in power, Elam would repulse them out of their land. 
### Shutrukid dynasty
It was at this point under the Shutrukid dynasty that Elam would reach the peak of their power. When the Kassites was weakened by their war with Assyria, Elam would take this chance to plunder Babylon and bring back trophies like the stele of Hammurabi and the stele of Naram-Sin. In 1158 BC Elam defeated Babylon and killed their king, replacing him with his son who eventually was rejected by the native Akkadian population. Elam didn't stop there though and went so far as to war with Assyria as well, even occupying the city of Arrapha. Ultimately, they were defeated and forced to sign a treaty with Assyria.

The power of Elam eventually waned after Nebuchadnezzar I of Babylon sacked Susa and Elam disappears into obscurity for over three centuries.

## Neo-Elamite period (1100 -540 BC)

### Neo-Elamite I (1100 - 770 BC)
Not much is known of Elam in this period. It appears they tried to ally with neighboring civilizations to fight the Neo-Assyrian empire.

### Neo-Elamite II (770 - 646 BC)
It was during this period that the Iranians and persians migrated to the Iranian plateau after which it was named. 

Elam sided with Babylon in their fight for independence from Assyria which failed. Elam managed to capture the city of Babylon in 694 BC. In response, the Assyrian king invaded and ravaged Elam. A few years later the Elamites would help the Babylonians fight the Assyrians again eventually resulting in the destruction of Babylon along with the defeat of Elam.

After another set of wars Susa was sacked and occupied by the Assyrians in 653 BC. After a period of respite during the Assyrian civil war. Elam, who was weakened by their own civil wars was again sacked by Assyria after Ashurbanipal had dealt with his brother. Assyria tried to install vassal kings in Susa which failed so instead they annexed and destroyed Elam.

### Neo-Elamite III (646 - 539 BC)
Despite the proclamations of Ashurbanipal a weak Elam would exist for another century. After the death of Ashurbanipal and with it the fragmenting of the Assyrian Empire, Elam would fall under the control of the Medians and eventually the Achaemenid Empire.

## Elymais (147 BC - 222 AD)
After the fall of the Achaemenid and Seleucid Empires the empire of Elymais was established, it served mainly as a vassal to the Parthian Empire. It ceased existing when the Parthian Empire fell.
# Religion
Elam was polytheistic, just like their neighbours. They also imported some of their deities from Akkad and Sumeria but had many of their own gods.

# Language
The language is separate in origin from their neighbors the Sumerian and is also not Semitic like the Akkadians. It is another language isolate like the Sumerian language.
