Elam (also known as Susiana by the Greeks) is the oldest known civilization in the territory of present-day Iran. The civilization was centered in the city of Susa in the Khuzetan lowlands. We mainly know Elam through their conflicts with [[Sumeria]] and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]. Elam along with the Amorites were the ones that sacked Ur and ended the [[Post-Akkadian Sumeria#Third Dynasty of Ur / Ur III / Neo-Sumerian Empire|Neo-Sumerian Empire]] and by doing so ending Sumerian hegemony in Mesopotamia for good. Elam was succeeded by the Persian Achaemenid dynasty in which Elam's culture played a central role. 
# History
