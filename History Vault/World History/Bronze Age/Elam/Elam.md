Elam (also known as Susiana by the Greeks) is the oldest known civilization in the territory of present-day Iran. The civilization was centered in the city of Susa in the Khuzetan lowlands. We mainly know Elam through their conflicts with [[Sumeria]] and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]. Elam along with the Amorites were the ones that sacked Ur and ended the [[Post-Akkadian Sumeria#Third Dynasty of Ur / Ur III / Neo-Sumerian Empire|Neo-Sumerian Empire]] and by doing so ending Sumerian hegemony in Mesopotamia for good. Elam was succeeded by the Persian Achaemenid dynasty in which Elam's culture played a central role. 

# Geography
Elam is positioned well both strategically and economically. The Iranian Plateau provides protection against invasion from the north and a wealth of ores. Elam was also the closest of two routes to the Indus civilization to the east making it a hub for trade and tolls.
# History
Elam was urbanized along with [[Sumeria]] during the [[Chalcolithic]] period at around 3000 BCE. The history of Elam can be divided into five periods.
## Proto-Elamite period
The Proto-Elamite period, also known as Susa II, stretches from 3100 - 2700 BC. In this period Elam has yet to be unified under one empire. That didn't happen until Old Elamite Period. Instead, what was to become Elam consisted of several separate city-states.

The texts from this period is written in Proto-Elamite script, an ideographic script similar to the Proto-Cuneiform. Proto-Elamite remains majority undeciphered though we still know the content of some texts through the symbolic meanings.

## Old Elamite Period
### Awan Dynasty
The Awan dynasty, the first known dynasty of Elam brings in the Old Elamite Period lasting between 2700 - 2150 BC. The Awan dynasty is partly contemporary with [[Sargon of Akkad]] who killed an emperor and subjected Susa. When the [[Akkadian Empire]] collapsed the last Awan king declared Elam independent. He then conquered Susa and Anshan and achieved political unity. But after his reign Elam was overrun by the Gutians for a century until the Sumerians conquered Susa under Shulgi of the Neo-Sumerian Empire.
### Shimashki dynasty
Lasting between 2050 - 1970 BC, when Susa and much of the plains was under Sumerian control the Shimashki dynasty in the mountains east of Susa lead Elam. This period was filled with strife between the Sumerians, Gutians, and Elamites. Eventually the Elamites allied with the people of Susa surrounded and sacked the city of Ur ending Sumeria for good. They were eventually driven out by the Akkadians from Isin.
### Sukkulmah dynasty
Susa was in this period (1970-1770 BC) under constant attack from other Mesopotamian states but it remained in the control of Elam. This dynasty would have great influence in the region before the establishment of the Babylonian Empire who would kick them out of Mesopotamia. They would still have great political influence when Babylon ruled Mesopotamia.
