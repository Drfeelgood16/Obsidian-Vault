Bronze is an alloy consisting of about seven parts copper to one part tin. It played a heavy part during the [[Bronze Age]] where it allowed people to create tools that were harder and more durable than the previously known copper or stone tools.

Before the widespread use of bronze with tin, there was another alloy with copper and arsenic called [[Arsenical Bronze]] in use during the [[Chalcolithic]] period. 

The earliest tin bronze is thought to be made from stannite; a natural tin-copper ore.

Bronze is actually harder than wrought iron
