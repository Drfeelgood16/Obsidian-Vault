Bronze is an alloy consisting of about seven parts copper to one part tin. It played a heavy part during the [[Bronze Age]] where it allowed people to create tools that were harder and more durable than the previously known copper or stone tools.

Before the widespread use of bronze with tin, there was another alloy with copper and arsenic called [[Arsenical Bronze]] in use during the [[Chalcolithic]] period. 

The earliest tin bronze is thought to be made from stannite; a natural tin-copper ore.

Bronze is actually harder than wrought iron. It is also more resilient against salt water corrosion making it suitable for use on boats. Friction against dissimilar metals are low, making Bronze suitable for cannons. Bronze alloys have an unusual property in that it expands right before it sets making it useful for getting fine details in sculptures.

Before glass mirrors the mirrors were made of polished bronze. The earliest of which is found in the Egyptian Middle Kingdom (2040 - 1750 BCE).

Copper coins are actually usually bronze coins with usually about 4% tin.
