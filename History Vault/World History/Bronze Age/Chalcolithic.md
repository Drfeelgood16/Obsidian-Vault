The chalcolithic, also known as the copper age, is the age between the [[Stone Age]] and the [[Bronze Age]]. it occurred at different periods in different areas just like the surrounding eras. Some areas never had a copper age, instead moving directly into the Bronze- or [[Iron Age]]. The name Chalcolithic might be a bit misleading since the suffix -lithic might make it seem like this is another [[stone age]].

The earliest finding of metallurgy is in the [[Fertile Crescent]] which are conical lead pieces. There is evidence of copper smelting contemporaneously with these lead pieces. But since lead is rare in this region it is possible that a culture somewhere else might have had invented lead smelting before copper smelting was discovered in [[Mesopotamia]].

During this era lithic tools got worse. This can be explained by specialist toolmakers and their customers preferring tools made of this new material. Which means that the people making lithic tools in this era are the household generalists; who, of course, can't make these tools as well as specialists can.

The earliest form of [[Bronze]], [[Arsenical Bronze]], was made during this era.
