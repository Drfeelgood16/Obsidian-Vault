Phoenicia was an ancient Semitic maritime civilization originating from the Levant. Phoenicians were closely connected with Canaan to the south and after Canaans fall even referring to themselves as Canaanites. In fact since Phoenicia is an exonym originating from Ancient Greece differentiating between Phoenicians and Canaanites might be a later invention. The Phoenicians were one of the few civilizations that survived the Late Bronze Age collapse until they were conquered by the Romans in 64 BC.
