Phoenicia was an ancient Semitic maritime civilization originating from the Levant in modern day Lebanon. Phoenicians were closely connected with Canaan to the south and after Canaans fall even referring to themselves as Canaanites. In fact since Phoenicia is an exonym originating from Ancient Greece differentiating between Phoenicians and Canaanites might be a later invention. The Phoenicians were one of the few civilizations that survived the Late Bronze Age collapse until they were conquered by the Romans in 64 BC.

Phoenicians are probably most well known for having the oldest alphabet. This alphabet was based on the Proto-Sinaitic script and was transmitted across the Mediterranean by the Phoenicians. It was then used by other civilizations to develop the Arabic script and the Greek alphabet. The Greek alphabet was the used to create our modern Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.


# History
We have very little surviving history from the Phoenicians themselves, instead most of what we know come from the account of other civilizations and excavations and those are also sparse. The early and middle Bronze Age is largely unknown and many sites haven't been excavated yet.

## Late Bronze Age
The earliest account that we have of the Phoenicians are when the Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III conquered coastal cities belonging to the *Fenekhu* in the 15th century BC. Phoenicia stayed under Egyptian control until around 1350 BC when the neighboring Amorites and Hittites captured some Phoenician cities.

## Late Bronze Age Collapse
The Phoenicians weathered the Bronze Age Collapse relatively well compared to the Egyptians and Hittites who were severely weakened. The Phoenicians exploited this by becoming the sole mercantile and maritime power in the region by re-establishing long-distance trade between Egypt and Mesopotamia. 

## Iron Age
This continued far into the Iron age and their influence might have reached so far as Sardinia and Spain while they had colonies on several Mediterranean islands. The height of Phoenicia is believed to be during the late Iron Age.
