Phoenicia was an ancient Semitic maritime civilization originating from the Levant in modern day Lebanon. Phoenicians were closely connected with Canaan to the south and after Canaans fall even referring to themselves as Canaanites. In fact since Phoenicia is an exonym originating from Ancient Greece differentiating between Phoenicians and Canaanites might be a later invention. The Phoenicians were one of the few civilizations that survived the Late Bronze Age collapse until they were conquered by the Romans in 64 BC.

Phoenicians are probably most well known for having the oldest alphabet. This alphabet was based on the Proto-Sinaitic script and was transmitted across the Mediterranean by the Phoenicians. It was then used by other civilizations to develop the Arabic script and the Greek alphabet. The Greek alphabet was the used to create our modern Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.

Carthage was created by the Phoenicians possibly as an intermediate outpost to ease trade with Spain and Sardinia.
# History
We have very little surviving history from the Phoenicians themselves, instead most of what we know come from the account of other civilizations and excavations and those are also sparse. The early and middle Bronze Age is largely unknown and many sites haven't been excavated yet.

## Late Bronze Age
The earliest account that we have of the Phoenicians are when the Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III conquered coastal cities belonging to the *Fenekhu* in the 15th century BC. Phoenicia stayed under Egyptian control until around 1350 BC when the neighboring Amorites and Hittites captured some Phoenician cities.

## Late Bronze Age Collapse
The Phoenicians weathered the Bronze Age Collapse relatively well compared to the Egyptians and Hittites who were severely weakened. The Phoenicians exploited this by becoming the sole mercantile and maritime power in the region by re-establishing long-distance trade between Egypt and Mesopotamia. 

## Iron Age
This continued far into the Iron age and their influence might have reached so far as Sardinia and Spain while they had colonies on several Mediterranean islands. The height of Phoenicia is believed to be during the late Iron Age.

Eventually during the latter half of the Iron Age when neighboring militaristic empires began to rise again the small mercantile city-states of Phoenicia had no means to defend themselves. As a result they ended up being vassals to the major powers in the region and had to pay great levies and taxes to their suzerain.

### Vassalage under Assyria
Under the rule of Tiglath-Pileser I (1115-1077 BC) Assyria invaded and conquered several Phoenician states but Assyria fell into decline and couldn't hold on the extremities of their territories including Phoenicia. After a period of expanding their territories northward and eastward the Assyrians eventually looked west towards the Levant.

In 858 BC as King Shalmaneser III rose to power in Assyria he began a series of campaigns against neighboring states. The Phoenician city-states eventually fell under Assyrian rule but due to a battle that most likely ended in a stalemate he was not able to take Damascus and exert unopposed control of the region. This lead to many Phoenician city-states remaining vassals.

This would change in 744 BC when Tiglath-Pileser III became ruler and once again invaded the Levant with greater success. He annexed most of Phoenicia excluding Tyre and Byblos who remained vassal states.

When Sargon II succeeded Tiglath-Pileser III in unclear circumstances several neighboring civilizations rebelled, among them the Syrian and Phoenician states supported by Egypt. The rebellion was doomed because of the lack of military to stop Sargon's advance eventually reaching Gaza and killing their king Hanunu. Egyptians tried again to foment a rebellion but it was thwarted by the Assyrians during planning.

Esarhaddon squashed another rebellion during his reign and went so far as to invade Egypt, even taking Memphis. Ashurbanipal would also campaign in the Levant and Egypt being the last Assyrian king with the power to do so. He would take Thebes and install a puppet government in Egypt. After the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC Assyria would devolve into a civil war allowing Phoenicia to fall out of Assyrian rule.

### Vassalage under Babylon
During the fall of the Assyrian Empire Phoenicia had a period of relative tranquility. That ended when the two empires of Babylon and Egypt came into conflict due to their differing interests in the Assyrian Empire. Egypt wanted a friendly weak Assyrian Empire in control of the Levant but their efforts were thwarted when the Babylonians conquered the last vestiges of the Assyrian Empire. Egypt and Babylon came into conflict in the Levant with the result being an Egyptian loss and Babylon occupying the entire eastern Mediterranean coast.

Nebuchadnezzar followed in the footsteps of every suzerain before him and heavily exploited the wealth of Phoenicia to his own benefit. As a result there were constant Phoenician revolts and Babylonian campaigns in response. In 586 BC, fresh from the destruction of Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar laid siege to Tyre for an incredible 13 years until the city's capitulation.

### Vassalage under the Achaemenid Empire
After the neglect of the rulers following Nebuchadnezzar it took little effort for the Achaemenids to wrest control of the Levant from Babylon. The annexation was finalized when Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon and the Phoenicians made the calculation to yield to the Achaemenids without resisting. The Phoenicians remained under Achaemenid rule for two centuries until the Achaemenids fell to Alexander the Great of Macedon.

Achaemenid rule was quite favorable for the Phoenicians to start with. The only paid about half of the tribute that they previously paid and they were given a lot of autonomy. In turn their maritime prowess gave the Persians a fleet to fight the Greeks in the Greco-Persian Wars. As a result of increasing tributes and punishments following the Achaemenid defeat at the Battle of Salamis the Phoenician city-state of Sidon led a failed rebellion against the Achaemenids leading to the destruction of Sidon.

## Hellenistic Period
Phoenicia was one of the first regions to be conquered by Alexander the Greats invasion into western Asia. During the seven month siege of Tyre many Phoenicians fled to Carthage. After Tyre fell the rest of Phoenicia easily came under Macedonian control. After a relatively uneventful few years under Macedonian rule Alexander the Great died in 323 BC the Phoenicians came under Seleucid rule. The Seleucids, being the geographically largest successor of Alexander's Empire had a hard time keeping Phoenicia. In the third century BC Phoenicia came under the rule of the Ptolemaic Kingdom who held it for a century until the Seleucids reclaimed them.

Under Seleucid rule the city-states of Phoenicia had a great deal of autonomy and during the Seleucid Dynastic Wars they were self-governed. Eventually the jews in the Levant revolted and defeated the Seleucids leaving the region to be self-governed until Tigranes the Great of Armenia conquered them. The Armenians only held onto the regions for a short time before the romans intervened and conquered the territory. Phoenicia was eventually incorporated into the province of Syria and under Roman rule the Phoenicians lost all of their autonomy.

# Culture
## Trade
The Phoenicians are known for their trade connecting all of the African coast of the Mediterranean from the Strait of Gibraltar in the west to the Levant in the east. The Phoenicians had a deep relationship with the Greeks exporting Near East culture and resources to the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations during the second millennium BC.

Other than being a middleman between civilizations Phoenicians main industry was cedar wood exports to Egypt and Mesopotamia who lacked wood resources themselves. Unable to solely live on this resource Phoenicians became skilled craftsmen in glass-making, metalworking, and wood-carving for both every day and luxury use.

The most prized Phoenician good was fabrics dyed in Tyrian Purple, a dye found in the *Murex* marine snail once common on the eastern Mediterranean coast. This expensive fabric became a status symbol in several civilizations, most notably the Romans.

The Phoenicians helped propagate wine across the Mediterranean and may have taught wine-making to their trading partners.

## Technology
The Phoenicians might be the first to invent the bireme and the trireme. The Phoenicians are also credited with inventing the Amphora.

## Politics
The city-states were highly independent and alliances were rare. Phoenician society was monarchical early on with a king at the top and nobles and merchants beneath him. Later on the councils were created to advise the kings, eventually taking greater power from the kings. Tyre later on in the sixth century even adopting a similar system to the Roman consuls.
