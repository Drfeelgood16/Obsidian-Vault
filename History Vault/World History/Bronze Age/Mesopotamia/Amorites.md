The Amorites was a semitic people originating from the north-western part of Mesopotamia. The Amorites gained prominence after the fall of Sumeria and would eventually create the Babylonian Empire. They also founded the Fourteenth Dynasty of Egypt.

# History

## Third Millenium BC
The first known mention of the Amorites are from texts written in Ur III that reference kings that lived in the Early Dynastic period of Sumeria like Enmerkar and Lugalbanda. They were also known to the Semitic kingdom of Ebla from around 2500 BC. The Amorites was one of the "four quarters of the world" that Akkad conquered.

The only description we have of the Amorites in the third millenia come from the Ur III period. They were described as a collection of nomadic tribes and them moving east towards Sumer was hard for the Sumerians to deal with. The Amorites along with the Elamites would eventually destroy the Neo-Sumerian empire and with it Sumerian hegemony for good.
## Second Millenium BC
In the chaos following the fall of the Neo-Sumerian Empire Amorite rulers gained power in several city-states in Mesopotamia and had several short-lived kingdoms. Kingdoms like Babylon, Mari, Yamhad, and even the short-lived Kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia. Babylon would eventually grow to consist of much of the Near East at it's peak and when Babylon fell so did Amorite influence in the Near East.

Around the 19th century there is believed to have existed an Amorite dynasty in Egypt.
