Naram-Sin was the fourth king of the [[Akkadian Empire]] he was preceded by his father [[Manishtushu]]. Naram-Sin was the greatest king since [[Sargon of Akkad]] (his grandfather) and ruled for 36 years. It was during Naram-Sin's rule that the Akkadian Empire was most vast. Naram-Sin was succeeded by his son Shar-Kali-Sharri after his death. 

Naram-Sin increased royal control over the city-states by appointing his sons as governors and his daughters as priestesses. He solidified control over Elam.

## The great revolt
At some point during his reign several city-states in [[Sumeria]] allied together and revolted against Naram-Sin. Naram-Sin quashed the rebellion and in the aftermath deified himself along with his father and grandfather.

## The Curse of Akkad
A Mesopotamian myth called "The Curse of Akkad" written hundreds of years after Naram-Sin died tries to explain how Akkad fell to the Gutians. According to the text Naram-Sin angered the god Enlil by plundering his temple. In his anger Enlil summoned the Gutians who brought with them plague, famine, and death. As a response eight gods decreed that the city of Akkad should be destroyed to spare the rest of Sumeria. The story then ends with the destruction of Akkad.

## Legacy
Naram-Sins legacy was so great that later kings named themselves after him. It is postulated that Nimrod from the bible might be a combination of Naram-Sin and his grandfather [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]].
