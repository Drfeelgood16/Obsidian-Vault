Shar-Kali-Sharri is the fifth ruler of the [[Akkadian Empire]]. He succeeded his father [[Naram-Sin]] as ruler and completed his attempt of direct Akkadian rule. His reign was relatively peaceful clashing only with the Elamites and the nomadic Gutians. The death of Shar-Kali-Sharri left a great power vacuum which left the empire in anarchy for a period of time until Dudu consolidated power.
