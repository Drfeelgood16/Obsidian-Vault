Sumer is the oldest civilization in [[Mesopotamia]] in modern day Iraq. The name Sumer comes from what the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] people called them. Sumerians themselves called their land "kengir" which translated means "Country of the noble lords". In the bible they are referred to as Shinar. Sumerians referred to themselves as the "black-headed people". 

Before the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian Empire]] Sumeria consisted of several city-states with a common language and culture. Wars between city-states was very common and cities were sacked back and forth.

It is disputed where the Sumerian people came from. There are theories that they come from the [[Indus valley]], the Caucasus, or Northern Africa.
## History of Sumeria

The history of Sumer lasts between about 5000 BCE to 2000 BCE and can be divided into several periods. In chronological order these periods are:

- [[Pre-Akkadian Sumeria#Ubaid Period|Ubaid Period]]  5500 - 3700 BCE
- [[Pre-Akkadian Sumeria#Uruk Period|Uruk Period]] 4000 - 3000 BCE
- [[Pre-Akkadian Sumeria#Jemdet Nasr Period|Jemdet Nasr Period]] 3100 - 2900 BCE
- [[Pre-Akkadian Sumeria#Early Dynastic Period|Early Dynastic Period]] 2900 - 2350 BCE
- [[Post-Akkadian Sumeria#Second Lagash Dynasty|Second Lagash Dynasty]] 2230–2110 BCE
- [[Post-Akkadian Sumeria#Fifth Dynasty of Uruk|Fifth Dynasty of Uruk]] 2055–2048 BCE
- [[Post-Akkadian Sumeria#Third Dynasty of Ur / Neo-Sumerian Empire|Neo-Sumerian Empire]] 2047–1940 BCE

After the fall of the Neo-Sumerian empire southern Mesopotamia became inhabited by the Semites from the northern parts of Mesopotamia who created the empires of [[Babylon]] and [[Assyria]].

## Culture
Sumerian culture was male-dominated and stratified. At the top sat the *Lugal* or *Ensi* beneath him was the free man or *lu*. Slavery was common at this time. 

Women weren't completely without rights though. They had an important role as a Temple Priestess, some of which even ruled cities. Women had the right to own property and inherited property on equal terms with their brothers. Women's powers would become more limited over time though. Polyandry was made illegal by Urukagina of Lagash.

The Sumerians had relaxed attitudes towards sex, believing for example that masturbation enhanced sexual potency for both men and women. Anal sex wasn't taboo either and was used as a form of birth control by the priestesses who were frobidden from producing offspring.

Marriage was mostly arranged by the parents and premarital sex was discouraged, though this might have been a later development.

Musically sumerians played the flute and the lyre, some of the latter have even survived to modern times.

The literature and culture of Sumeria influenced the ancient Israelites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Hittites, and even the Greeks. For example the text "Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta" has a similar narrative to the Torahs Tower of Babel parable.

 The Sumerians invented the astrological sign and the 24 hour clock by dividing the day up into 12 day-hours and 12 night-hours.
## Language
The written language of Sumeria started out as hieroglyphic using ideograms. Eventually it developed into the well known *cuneiform* with the wedge shaped strokes. A well known work from Sumeria is the *Epic of Gilgamesh* parts of which was written during the [[Post-Akkadian Sumeria#Third Dynasty of Ur / Ur III / Neo-Sumerian Empire|Ur III]]  period. What is unique about ancient Sumerian texts is that they are unmodified by later compilers and commentators unlike the Bible or the Iliad who have had millenniums of modifications to the source material.

The Sumerian language is a language isolate since it has no known antecedents or descendants. 

Sumerian served as a scholarly and religious language long after the Semites took over Mesopotamia. Similar to how latin is used during the middle-ages and later.

## Religion
Sumerian religion is polytheistic and each city served their own god. These gods were all in the same pantheon.
### Cosmology
The Sumerians believed that heaven and earth was created by the goddess Nammu and that they were united in the form of a primeval sea. The union of the male god of heaven, *An*, and the female god of earth, *Ki*, created Enlil, the god of Air. Enlil then separated heaven and earth and carried off his mother, earth, while his father carried of heaven. The union between Enlil and Ki set the stage for the organization of the universe, the creation of man, and the establishment of civilization.

The Sumerian word for universe is an-ki aka "heaven-earth" and the universe can therefore be subdivided into heaven and earth. Heaven consists of the sky and "the great above" where the sky-gods dwell. Earth consists of the ground and "the great below" which contains the underworld and the chthonic deities. Below "the great below" is the primeval sea that Nammu inhabits where Enlil was born.

### Gods

The gods and their relations are as such:
* **Nanna**, the moon god, is born of Enlil, the Air god, and his wife Ninlil, the air-goddess. 
* **Utu**, the sun god, is born from Nanna, the moon god, and his wife Ningal
* **Enki**, the water god, and god of wisdom begat
* **Uttu**, the goddess of plants.
* **Labar**, the god of cattle
* **Ashnan**, the grain goddess

### Myths

Some time after heaven and earth was separated Ereshkigal was taken to the underworld by Kur, The ruler of the underworld (Kur is also the name for the underworld, like hades in greek mythology). In response Enki, the water god, sailed off to rescue or avenge Ereshkigal. The result of this tale is unknown since we only know it as a prelude to another story (Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the underworld). What is most likely is that Enki was victorious. This myth is the earliest form of the dragon-slaying myth that we know from greek mythology for example.

The myth of a great flooding is Sumerian in origin and so is also the famous Ark that saves the people.

### Temples and Worship
Sumerian Temples were called ziggurats and were giant pyramids made from fired and unfired bricks. Only priestesses were allowed to be on the ziggurats in which they lived on the lower levels. The gods themselves were supposed to live at the top of the ziggurat and only the head temple priestess was allowed up there to communicate with them.

The sumerian people worshipped mainly the god of the city but the neighboring cities gods were part of the same pantheon.

## Life
Sumerians lived in great cities with populations up to about 80 000. Technological advancements like irrigation, pottery, and the pickax made supporting this amount of people possible. The irrigation system was vast and complex and allowed the Sumerians to grow crops to excess enough that they were a wealthy people through trade. 

Work was commonly given out by the government for upkeep of old irrigation trenches or to build new ones. This allowed the landless to get food without owning a farm themselves.

## Trade
Mesopotamia was a central hub between India, Egypt, and Europe. Sumerian export of grain allowed them to purchase vast amounts of tin from either Elam, India, or Egypt to supply them with bronze tools. They imported gold and jewelry from Egypt.
