Sumer is the oldest civilization in [[Mesopotamia]] in modern day Iraq. The name Sumer comes from what the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] people called them. Sumerians themselves called their land "kengir" which translated means "Country of the noble lords". Sumerians also referred to themselves as the "black-headed people". 

Before the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian Empire]] Sumeria consisted of several city-states with a common language and culture. Wars between city-states was very common and cities were sacked back and forth.

It is disputed where the Sumerian people came from. There are theories that they come from the [[Indus valley]], the Caucasus, or Northern Africa.
## History of Sumeria

The history of Sumer lasts between about 5000 BCE to 2000 BCE and can be divided into several periods. In chronological order these periods are:

- [[Pre-Akkadian Sumeria#Ubaid Period|Ubaid Period]]  5500 - 3700 BCE
- [[Pre-Akkadian Sumeria#Uruk Period|Uruk Period]] 4000 - 3000 BCE

## Culture
Sumerian culture was male-dominated and stratified. At the top sat the *Lugal* or *Ensi* beneath him was the free man or *lu*. Slavery was common at this time. 

Women weren't completely without rights though. They had an important role as a Temple Priestess, some of which even ruled cities. Women had the right to own property and inherited property on equal terms with their brothers. Women's powers would become more limited over time though. Polyandry was made illegal by Urukagina of Lagash.

The Sumerians had relaxed attitudes towards sex, believing for example that masturbation enhanced sexual potency for both men and women. Anal sex wasn't taboo either and was used as a form of birth control by the priestesses who were frobidden from producing offspring.

Marriage was mostly arranged by the parents and premarital sex was discouraged, though this might have been a later development.

Musically sumerians played the flute and the lyre, some of the latter have even survived to modern times.

The literature and culture of Sumeria influenced the ancient Israelites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Hittites, and even the Greeks. For example the text "Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta" has a similar narrative to the Torahs Tower of Babel parable.
## Language
The written language of Sumeria started out as hieroglyphic using ideograms. Eventually it developed into the well known *cuneiform* with the wedge shaped strokes. A well known work from Sumeria is the *Epic of Gilgamesh* written in standard Sumerian cuneiform. What is unique about ancient Sumerian texts is that they are unmodified and uncodified by later compilers and commentators like the Bible or the Iliad who have had millenias of modifications of the source material.

The Sumerian language is a language isolate since it has no known antecedents or descendants. 

Sumerian served as a scholarly and religious language long after the Semites took over Mesopotamia. Similar to how latin is used during the middle-ages and later.

## Religion
Sumerian religion is polytheistic and each city served their own god. These gods were all in the same pantheon.
### Cosmology
The Sumerians believed that heaven and earth was created by the goddess Nammu and that they were united in the form of a primeval sea. The union of the male god of heaven, *An*, and the female god of earth, *Ki*, created Enlil, the god of Air. Enlil then separated heaven and earth and carried off his mother, earth, while his father carried of heaven. The union between Enlil and Ki set the stage for the organization of the universe, the creation of man, and the establishment of civilization.

The Sumerian word for universe is an-ki aka "heaven-earth" and the universe can therefore be subdivided into heaven and earth. Heaven consists of the sky and "the great above" where the sky-gods dwell. Earth consists of the ground and "the great below" which contains the underworld and the chthonic deities.

The gods and their relations are as such:
* **Nanna**, the moon god, is born of Enlil, the Air god, and his wife Ninlil, the air-goddess. 
* **Utu**, the sun god, is born from Nanna, the moon god, and his wife Ningal
* **Enki**, the water god, and god of wisdom begat
* **Uttu**, the goddess of plants.
* **Labar**, the god of cattle
* **Ashnan**, the grain goddess

Sumerians believed in an afterlife in the underworld and that unburied people would have no rest in the nether world.
