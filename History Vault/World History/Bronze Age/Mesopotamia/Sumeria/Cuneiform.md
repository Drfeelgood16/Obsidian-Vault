Cuneiform is the script used in the Ancient Near East, notably in [[Sumeria]] and the [[Akkadian Empire]]. The cuneiform is not a single type of script but a family which has descended from the proto-cuneiform used in [[Sumeria#Uruk period|Uruk Period]] Sumeria. This developed into the earliest syllabic Cuneiform in the [[Sumeria#Jemdet Nasr period|Jemdet Nasr]] and [[Sumeria#Early Dynastic period|Early Dynastic period]]. Cuneiform was used and developed for over three millenia when it was replaced by an alphabetic orthography under the Roman era.

The earliest form of writing found is in the form proto-cuneiform tablets found in [[Uruk]].
