The Sumerian King List is a literary work by a scribe of Utu-Hegal that tries to legitimize his rule after the fall of the [[Akkadian Empire]]. It argues that Utu-Hegal is the true descendant of the kingship of all of Sumeria by listing [Sumerian](Sumeria.md) cities and their rulers along with the length of their rule. It used to be an invaluable source for scholars researching the early dynasty of Sumeria but the reasons behind it's creation along with some irregularities make it an unreliable source.

The first king we have secondary and archaeological sources for is Enmebaragesi, king of [[Kish]], who is said to have won a war against Elam and taken their weapons as spoils. Enmebaragesi is also known through literary references in which he was rivals with other early rulers of [[Uruk]].
