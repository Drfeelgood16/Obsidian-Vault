Inanna is a [[Sumeria|Sumerian]] goddess known there as the "Queen of Heaven". She is the goddess of love, war, and fertility. In Sumerian culture Inanna is connected to the planet Venus. Elsewhere Inanna is known as Ishtar. Inanna has three forms: Morning Innana, Evening Inanna, and Princely Inanna. 

She was worshipped by the Sumerians as far back as 4000 BCE and it continued through [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], [[Assyria|Assyrian]], and [[Babylon|Babylonian]] rule. She was especially beloved by the Assyrians who ranked her above their national god [[Ashur]].

She might have had influence as far as the Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]].

She was married to the god [[Dumuzid]] and her attendant (sukkal) was the god [[Ninshubur]].

She is often symbolized by a lion or an [[Star of Inanna|Eight-pointed star]]

The district of [[Eanna]] in Uruk houses a temple dedicated to Inanna.


In the mythology Inanna was given the "me" or metaphysical concepts of things like prostitution etc. during a drunken stupor of [[Enki]].

# Inanna's descent to the underworld
The myth "Inanna's descent to the underworld" tells the story of when Inanna descended to the underworld in search of power. She was judged and killed by the seven Anunnas for her hubris. Enki created two beings that brought her back on one condition --she had to bring a substite in her stead. Her husband Dumuzid angered her in an unknown way and was the one chosen to be in her stead.

Unlike what the wikipedia page says, the claim that the gala-tura and kur-jara was genderless is not sourced correctly on the page, their gender is just unspecified.
