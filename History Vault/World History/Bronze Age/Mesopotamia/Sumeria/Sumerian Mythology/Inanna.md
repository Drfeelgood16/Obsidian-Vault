Inanna is a [[Sumeria|Sumerian]] goddess known there as the "Queen of Heaven". She is the goddess of love, war, and fertility. In Sumerian culture Inanna is connected to the planet Venus. Elsewhere Inanna is known as Ishtar. Inanna has three forms: Morning Innana, Evening Inanna, and Princely Inanna. 

She was worshipped by the Sumerians as far back as 4000 BCE and it continued through [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], [[Assyria|Assyrian]], and [[Babylon|Babylonian]] rule. She was especially beloved by the Assyrians who ranked her above their national god [[Ashur]].

She might have had influence as far as the Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]].

She was married to the god [[Dumuzid]] and her attendant (sukkal) was the god [[Ninshubur]].

She is often symbolized by a lion or an [[Star of Inanna|Eight-pointed star]]

The district of [[Eanna]] in Uruk houses a temple dedicated to Inanna.


In the mythology Inanna was given the "me" or metaphysical concepts of things like prostitution etc. during a drunken stupor of [[Enki]].

# Inanna's descent to the underworld
The myth "Inanna's descent to the underworld" tells the story of when Inanna descended to the sumerian version of the land of the dead. When she arrives in the underworld she is separated from her belongings and turned into a corpse. Her *sukkal* Ninshubur, following Inannas orders, plead with the gods Enlil, Nanna, and Enki for her safe return. Enlil and Nanna refused her because Inannas lust for power displeased them.
