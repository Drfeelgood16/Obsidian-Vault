Sumerian history can be divided into several

# Ubaid Period
The Ubaid period is a [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] period that lasts from about 5500 - 3700 BCE. The name comes from Tell al-'Ubaid; the largest early excavation of material from this period. The Ubaid culture has the first temples of public architecture in Mesopotamia. The Ubaid culture saw increased social stratification and was the first period to see an elite class of hereditary chieftains. The method of expansion during this era was cultural and ideological compared to the later militaristic Uruk expansions. We don't know for certain if warfare happened during this era. In modern Kuwait, which would have been far below sea in this period, archaeologists have found boats that come from this region, proving that sailing had been invented during or before the Ubaid period.

The people living in Mesopotamia in the Ubaid period is thought to be different from the people we now know as Sumerians. The Sumerians didn't arrive in Sumer until the Uruk Period.

# Uruk Period
The Uruk period is also known as the protoliterate period, it is on the cusp of prehistory and history. It spans from around 4000 BCE to 3000 BCE. This age saw decreasing use of pottery in favour of the new bronze material. The Uruk period can be broadly split into three phases: Old, middle, and late. The old period is the transition from the Ubaid culture into the Uruk and the initial urbanization. The middle period is an age of expansion and in the late period Uruk's influence diminished with an increase of cultural diversity. The sumerian language was first used during the late Uruk period. 

The period has got it's name from the the city of [[Uruk]], the largest city in Sumeria and the centre during this period. The reach of Uruk culture stretches as far as southeastern Anatolia and central Iran with very little to almost no influence in the Levant. Though Uruk culture was central during this period it was still just a collection of cities, it wasn't until the [[Akkadian Empire]] that the entirety of Sumeria was united under one ruler.

This period sees widespread use of the pottery wheel, writing, and the invention of the state. The many developments within agricultural technology is thought to be behind the growth and proliferation of this era. These developments include better irrigation techniques, the invention of the ard (a plough pulled by an animal) that greatly lessened the burden on farmers and increased yields. The improvements during this era were so great some call this era the "Second Agricultural Revolution".

It is not only agriculture that saw great gains but pastoralism also. The wild Onager was domesticated into becoming the Donkey. The donkey became the most important beast of burden in the Near East. Previously domesticated animals like sheep and cattle who were primarily raised for their meat started being used for their wool or milk also. Increased use of sheep for their wool allowed farmers to forego the plantation of flax for linen. Wool was also easier exported than food allowing for increased trade with other civilizations for primary materials like metals.

The fast spinning pottery wheel and the improved kiln and methods like coating allowed for mass-production of pots. This made pottery more pervasive and allowed for more people to utilize it. It is debated whether the wheel was invented in this period or in the periods afterwards. There are some depictions of vehicles on what appear to be wheels but it is not certain that they are. The earliest wheels were solid blocks it took about a thousand years to develop spokes.

With these inventions Sumer had a greater surplus of food which allowed further stratifications of society. The elites during this era were the priests who acted as middle men between the normal people and the patron gods. These elites also formed the first centralized governments with archives of who owns what land or which slaves for example.  The food surplus also allowed a greater amount of increasingly specialized workers and some of the governments largest institutions even had departments devoted to a single activity. But even with these increasingly large institutions there was no planned economy. In fact there was very little accounting of what was produced and trade happened on a lower level than the institutions account for.
# Jemdet Nasr Period
The Jemdet Nasr (3100 - 2900 BCE) is a small transitional period between the Uruk and Early Dynastic period and is named after the type site Tell Jemdet Nasr in Iraq. What defines the period is the distinctive painted pottery. Developments during this period mainly focuses on the [[Cuneiform]] script changing from being a pictographic language into using more simplified letters.

# Early Dynastic Period
The early dynastic period (2900 - 2350 BCE) is marked by a change of power structures in that it comes from a more secular leader called a Lugal (Lu = man, Gal = great) instead of from the temples. Some cities were still ruled by a more religious "En" or "Ensi".

This period is associated with an increase in war. This made walled cities necessary and walled cities grew even larger because they offered protection.

The early dynastic period is famous for when [[Gilgamesh]] is said to have ruled Sumeria. Syllabic writing first occurred. 

The Early dynastic can be divided into sub-periods ED I, ED II, ED IIIa, and ED IIIb. These periods originate from the changes over time of the Abu Temple in Tell Asmar. This period marks the end of distinguishing eras archaeologically we instead mark the end of periods by their rulers. The end of the Dynastic period is, for example, marked by the conquests of [[Sargon of Akkad]] which lead in to the [[Akkadian Empire|akkadian]] period. Because of this it is not possible to distinguish if sites are ED III or Akkadian purely by archaeological means.

We have no contemporary documents from the ED I and II periods that shed light on most of the political developments. What we do have instead is many documents that show the pious acts of rulers like constructing temples. It is likely that the rule of a city was split between its lugal and a council of elders who always advised the lugal before every action.

There are examples of hegemony and of leagues between city-states but there was no single ruling body over the entirety of Sumeria until the following [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian period]]. Texts from Shuruppak seem to confirm a [[Ki-engir]] league between the cities Umma, Lagash, [[Uruk]], Nippur, Adab, and Kish.

The first recorded war took place in this period. This war took place in around 2700 BCE and the parties were Sumer under Enmebaragesi, the king of Kish, and [[Elam]]. The Sumerians won and "carried away as spoils the weapons of Elam". But Sumerians didn't only fight outsiders but it seems wars between sumerian cities was also common and only ended with the emergence of the [[Akkadian Empire]].

Agriculture was extremely productive in early dynastic Sumeria. It has been postulated that in ED III three quarters of the total population in the near east resided in Sumeria. This extreme productiveness lead to vastly increased trade. This trade was also necessary for the Sumerians because they lacked natural resources like copper, tin, gold, and wood which was essential for a prospering empire and to conduct warfare. So they imported gold from [[Egypt]] or [[Nubia]], copper from Oman, Tin from iran, and wood from Lebanon and exported their excesses of food, wool, and other agricultural and pastoral products.

The city that benefited most from this trade was the city of Ur. It sat at the top of the Persian gulf by the mouth of the Euphrates. This ideal location allowed easy travel by waters from the west and east. The Euphrates allowed trade from the Levant and Egypt in the west while the Persian gulf allowed trade from India in the east. We know of Urs great wealth through their cemeteries which had an abundance of expensive objects compared to cemeteries in other Sumerian cities. Resin from as far as Mozambique has been found in a tomb in Ur.

The earliest known legal code and legal reform in recorded history is the Code of Urukagina of Lagash. The code itself has sadly not survived but we do know it existed through secondary sources. The code was a reformation of the laws of the corrupt previous king and was an attempt to reach higher levels of equality and freedom. For example it decreed that the rich must use silver when purchasing from the poor and the rich man is not allowed to force the poor man to sell his wares if he does not want to. It also outlawed polyandry with the punishment being stoning with rocks upon which the crime was written.

Metalworking was quite intricate especially so if you take into account that all the metals had to be imported.

## Dynasties
As the name implies the Early dynastic period was lead by several dynasties originating from different cities in Sumeria. Most of the information we have of these dynasties are just mentions in the [[Sumerian King List]] (SKL) of who ruled when and where.
#### First dynasty of Kish
There is little archaeological evidence of the rulers from this dynasty except from the disputed SKL. The earliest known king of Kish who is named in sources other than the SKL is Etana. The earliest king with archaeological evidence supporting his existence is Enmebaragesi who fought a war against the [Elamites](Elam) and won.
#### First Dynasty of Uruk
According to the SKL Meshkiangasher is the first king-priest of Uruk followed by his son king Enmerkar who built the city. There are two known legends that take place in this dynasty: The [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and [[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]].
#### First dynasty of Ur
In the SKL the final ruler of First Dynasty Uruk was overthrown by Mesannepada of Ur. The dynasty of Ur had after Mesannepada three other kings according to the SKL: Mes-kiagnun, Elulu, and Balulu. We know of earlier kings than Mesannepada that are not mentioned in the SKL. 
#### Dynasty of Awan
According to the SKL Ur was defeated and the kingship moved to Awan in [[Elam]].
#### Second Dynasty of Uruk
A notable king is Enshakushanna who conquered Hamazi along with other Sumerian cities and claimed hegemony over Sumeria. He adopted the title "en ki-en-gi lugal kalam" which translated means "lord of Sumer and king of all the land". He was succeeded but it seems the hegemony did not pass down with the successor.
#### Empire of Lugal-Ane-mundu of Adab
After a brief dynasty in Ur the kingship was taken to Adab by Lugal-Ane-mundu who reigned for 90 years according to the SKL. He reigned over the entirety of Mesopotamia, the first king to do so but when he died his kingdom was shattered.
#### Third Dynasty of Kish
Kubaba is the only king in the Third Dynasty and she is unique in that she is the only woman in the SKL to reign as "king." She is noted as having been a tavern-keeper before gaining kingship and was later worshipped as a minor goddess.
#### First Dynasty of Lagash
This dynasty, unlike previous ones, is not mentioned in the SKL. In fact because of the omission of Lagash there exists a satire on the subject called "The Rulers of Lagash".[^1] Enhegal is believed to be the first ruler of Lagash but we only have record of a business transaction he made therefore both his status and dating is disputed. The third ruler, Ur-Nanshe, is one we know actually ruled Lagash but we do not know when exactly. His son Akurgal ruled after him.
##### Eannatum of Lagash
After Akurgal came Eannatum. Eannatum is said to have conquered the entirety of Sumeria like Lugal-ane-mundu. His reach did not reach the Mediterranean like Luga-ane-mundu, reaching only as far as Mari but he instead conquered the Elamites in the east. His empire wasn't stable and there were many revolts during his reign. He was succeeded by his brother and then his nephew Entemena. Entemena increased the power of Lagash during his rule and were succeeded by two more minor rulers: Enentarzi and Lugalanda. After them came Urukagina who is famous for his political reforms (as mentioned earlier).

#### Empire of Lugalzagesi
Lugalzagesi, originally from Umma defeated Urukagina and Sumeria until his rule was overthrown by [[Sargon of Akkad]] who created the [[Akkadian Empire]].
