# Second Lagash Dynasty
Following the death of [[Shar-Kali-Sharri]] Puzur-Mama declared Lagash independent. This independence didn't come without consequences and it is believed that the Akkadians recieved tribute from Lagash after their independence. It wasn't until Ur-Ningirsu I and the fall of the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian Empire]] to the Gutians that Lagash was fully independent.

Little is known of the four rulers after Puzur-Mama except that they had years named after them. In order they are called Lu-Baba, Lugula, Kaku, and Ur-Baba.

After Ur-Baba came Gudea and with him a period marked with riches and power for Lagash. Gudea is known to have conducted some military operations in the east. He was also prodigious restorer of temples. The most notable object from this period for historians is the Gudea Cylinder which contains the longest known text in Sumerian. He was succeded by his son Ur-Ningirsu and Ur-Gar after him, both of whom we know little about.

The last ruler of the Second Dynasty is Nam-Mahani who is mainly known for being defeated by Ur-Nammu of Ur.

# Fifth Dynasty of Uruk
The fifth dynasty of Uruk consists of only one ruler. It is believed that Utu-Hengal was a governor of Uruk that revolted against the Gutian rule and later would lead the cities of Sumer to overthrow the Gutian king Tirigan. After the victory against the Gutians he established himself as king of Sumeria until his seventh year when he died in an accident. He was succeeded by his son-in-law Ur-Nammu, the governor of Ur.

# Third Dynasty of Ur / Ur III / Neo-Sumerian Empire
After the death of Utu-Hengal who drove away the Gutians, Ur-Nammu of Ur founded the Third Dynasty of Ur by killing the last ruler of the Second Lagash Dynasty in battle. To consolidate power he wrote the famous *Code of Ur-Nammu*.

Ur-Nammus successor Shulgi made sweeping reforms in the empire by instituting taxes, a national calendar, and archives. Shulgi wasn't a passive leader and his military conquest were many. He captured Susa from the Elamites and expanded northwards towards Akkad. At the height of the expansion Ur reached as far as Anatolia.

After a failed campaign into Elam, the Elamites combined forces with Susa and surrounded Ur. They sacked the city, ended the dynasty and occupied Sumeria. This would be the end of Sumerian rule in Mesopotamia. Eventually the semites would kick out the Elamites from Sumeria and establish the civilization of [[Babylon]].
