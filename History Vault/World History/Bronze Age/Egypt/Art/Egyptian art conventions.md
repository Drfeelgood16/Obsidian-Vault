The representation of Egyptian kings in art is very special. They were depicted with their legs, feet, and head in profile while the torso is turned to face the viewer head on. One eye, though the face is in profile, is depicted as if it was looking at the viewer head on also. It is thought that the reason why this method was used was to depict the most complete information possible about a person from a flat surface.
