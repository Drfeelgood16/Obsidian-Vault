In Ancient Egypt there was no "pure" art, instead all art had an ideological or religious purpose. It was thought that to depict someone in art would give the subject permanence and therefore all art were an idealized version of the world.

For example people were depicted with their legs, feet, and head in profile while the torso is turned to face the viewer head on. One eye, though the face is in profile, is depicted as if it was looking at the viewer head on. When not seated the men were depicted with one foot forward while the women were depicted with the feet together.  It is thought that the reason for this convention was to depict the most complete information possible about a person from a flat surface.

The proportions between the different body parts were also drawn after a set principle. The standard unit was the size of the fist and the distance from head to toe was 18 fists. If we use this size to divide the art into separate cells and lines the navel usually sat at the 11th line from the bottom. These proportions were only reserved for important people like rulers regular people were portrayed more freely.

The proportions between people was also important to the Ancient Egyptians. Subjects were usually portrayed with the most important figure being the largest. Usually the gods or the divine pharaoh was the largest, the high official smaller than them and servants being the smallest.

These standards were already in use when creating the Narmer Pallette from the 31st century BC and stayed in use until the conquest of Alexander the Great.

The creation of art was collective instead of individual and the names of the artist were not considered to be important so they were left out.

# Symbolism
Since art in Ancient Egypt didn't consider realism important art was instead incredibly symbolic. The clothes the Pharaoh wore, the animals depicted, the colors used had symbolic meaning. 

The Egyptian language only had terms for four colors who, in art, has different meanings. Blue/green symbolizes the Nile and it's vegetation, therefore symbolizing fertility, rejuvenation, growth. Black also symbolizes the alluvial plain and the earth in general so similar to green it symbolizes fertility and regeneration. Earth and therefore black also is associated with the afterlife. Gold and silver was associated with divinity even so far as being called "flesh of the god" and "bones of the god" respectively. Red, orange, and yellow, the last color group, had many associations. They could be symbolizing the sun or the desert. Red is also the color used for writing on papyrus.
