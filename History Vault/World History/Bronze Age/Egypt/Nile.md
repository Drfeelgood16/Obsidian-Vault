The Nile is a river that runs throughout most of North-East Africa. The source of the Nile is the Ethiopian Highlands on the one hand and Lake Victoria on the other. The rivers from these sources before they meet in Khartoum are called the *White Nile* and *Blue Nile* respectively. The Nile is one of the longest rivers in the world and is the main source of water for several African countries.
