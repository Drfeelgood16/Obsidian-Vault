The royal titulary is the standard naming conventions of Pharaohs in Ancient Egypt. The system is also referred to as "the great five names." In short, the Pharaohs were given five names that symbolized power, might, and could also act as a mission statement.
# Horus Name **ìÖÉìäÅ**
The Horus name is the oldest of the five names reaching as far back as pre-dynastic Egypt to the Naqada II period at about 3400 BC. The Horus name is usually represented by a [[Serekh]] with the Pharaohs name inside it with a god, usually Horus hence the name, sitting on top of it. Modern Egyptologists prefer the term "serekh name" since some Pharaohs placed other deities like [[Set]] on top instead of the falcon representing Horus.
## Symbology
The Horus name is thought to represent the commonly held belief that the Pharaoh was an earthly manifestation of the god Horus. The eagle could also represent omnipresence and a vast power.

# Nebty Name 
The Nebty name or "Two-Ladies name" is the second oldest royal title first being used by the pharaoh Semerkhet of the First Dynasty. The Nebty name is represented by two glyphs next to each other, the first glyph is a griffon vultures sitting on a basket, the second is a cobra sitting on a basket. Nebty (nbtj) is a contraction of the two goddesses Nekhbet and Wadjet of whom the name and symbols symbolizes. The name is also thought to represent a unified Egypt and as a royal title the pharaoh wished to present themselves as the ruler of it.

# Horus of Gold
The Horus of Gold is represented by a Horus falcon perched above or beside the hieroglyph for gold. The Horus of Gold sees its first use in the Fourth Dynasty. The Horus of Gold is thought to symbolize the triumph of Horus over his uncle Set.

# Prenomen
The Prenomen or carthouche name or throne name is represented by a sedge and bee *nswt-bjtj*. It is thought to symbolize the dual kingship of Upper (sedge) and Lower (bee) Egypt.
