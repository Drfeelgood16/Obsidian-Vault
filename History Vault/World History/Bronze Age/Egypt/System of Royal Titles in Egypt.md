The royal titulary is the standard naming conventions of Pharaohs in Ancient Egypt. The Pharaohs were given five names that symbolized power, might, and also acting as a mission statement.

The five names in chronological order from their initial use are:

* The **Horus** name
* The **Nebty** name
* The **Gold Falcon** name
* The **Prenomen**
* The **Nomen**

# Horus Name
The Horus name originates from prehistoric Egypt and many of the oldest known pharaohs are only known by their Horus name. The Horus name is usually written inside of a [[Serekh]] with the falcon god Horus perched on top or beside it.

One Second Dynastic ruler used an image of the god Set instead of Horus in his serekh.
