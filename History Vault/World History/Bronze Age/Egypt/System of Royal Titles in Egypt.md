The royal titulary is the standard naming conventions of Pharaohs in Ancient Egypt. The system is also referred to as "the great five names." In short, the Pharaohs were given five names that symbolized power, might, and could also act as a mission statement.
# Horus Name
The Horus name is the oldest of the five names reaching as far back as pre-dynastic Egypt to the Naqada II period at about 3400 BC. The Horus name is usually represented by a [[Serekh]] with the Pharaohs name inside it with a god, usually Horus hence the name, sitting on top of it. Modern Egyptologists prefer the term "serekh name" since some Pharaohs placed other deities like [[Set]] on top instead of the falcon representing Horus.
## Symbology
The Horus name is thought to represent the commonly held belief that the Pharaoh was an earthly manifestation of the god Horus. The eagle could also represent omnipresence and a vast power.

# Nebty Name
Nebty (nbtj) is a combination and contraction of the names of the goddesses Nekhbet and Wadjet.
