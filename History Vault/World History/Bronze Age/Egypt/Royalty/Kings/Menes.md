Menes is a mythical pharaoh who is credited with uniting Upper and Lower Egypt. With very little archaeological evidence from the Early Dynastic period mentioning Menes it is thought that Menes is another name for Narmer or possibly Hor-Aha. The majority of egyptologists believe Menes and Narmer are the same.

The name Menes originates from the Ptolemaic historian and priest Manetho.

Menes according to myth either united Egypt or was given the throne by [[Horus]].
