Full name: *Hor-Narmer* aka Fierce catfish of Horus. The name is spelled by using the hieroglyphs for a catfish *n'r* and a chisel *mr* which by using the rebus principle spells Narmer. His name is often abbreviated to the catfish symbol alone depending on the situation.

Narmer was an ancient Egyptian Pharaoh of the Early Dynastic Period. He is most known for uniting Upper and Lower Egypt and by doing so creating the First Dynasty. History to the Egyptians probably started with Narmer because of how much of a milestone the unification of Egypt was.

Neithhotep is thought to either be his queen consort or daughter. Her name means "Neith is satisfied" which suggests that she was from Lower Egypt. The marriage between Neithhotep and Narmer could have been political to consolidate power in lower Egypt. Neithhotep might be the earliest woman whose name is known to us from archaeological evidence rather than through myths.

It is thought that Narmer made an expedition to Canaan and that during his reign was the peak of Egyptian influence in Canaan. 33 *serekhs* has been found in Canaan, of which 20 are Narmers spread out over 9 different sites. It is not known if Narmer invaded Canaan or traded and colonized it. The majority think the latter but there are signs of a Egyptian military presence in Canaan from this period. Either way it is likely that Narmer made a military campaign in the region to assert his influence over it.

# Menes
Menes is a mythical pharaoh who is credited with uniting Upper and Lower Egypt. With very little archaeological evidence from the Early Dynastic period mentioning Menes it is thought that Menes is another name for Narmer or possibly Hor-Aha. The majority of egyptologists believe Menes and Narmer are the same, Menes being the prenomen/nebty name and Narmer being the Horus name.

The reason behind the uncertainty is that the contemporary archaeological evidence only uses the Horus name while most New Kingdom era king lists uses the personal name (usually prenomen or nomen).

Menes according to myth either united Egypt or was given the throne by [[Horus]].
