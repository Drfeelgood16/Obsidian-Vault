Narmer was an ancient Egyptian Pharaoh of the Early Dynastic Period. He is most known united Upper and Lower Egypt and by doing so creating the First Dynasty. It is believed by a majority of Egyoptologists that Narmer and [[Narmer]] are the same person. 

Neithhotep is thought to either be his queen consort or daughter.

# Menes
Menes is a mythical pharaoh who is credited with uniting Upper and Lower Egypt. With very little archaeological evidence from the Early Dynastic period mentioning Menes it is thought that Menes is another name for Narmer or possibly Hor-Aha. The majority of egyptologists believe Menes and Narmer are the same, Menes being the prenomen and Narmer being the Horus name.

Menes according to myth either united Egypt or was given the throne by [[Horus]].
