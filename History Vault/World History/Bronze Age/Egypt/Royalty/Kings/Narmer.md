Full name: *Hor-Narmer* aka Fierce catfish of Horus. The name is spelled by using the hieroglyphs for a catfish *n'r* and a chisel *mr* which by using the rebus principle spells Narmer. His name is often abbreviated to the catfish symbol alone depending on the situation.

Narmer was an ancient Egyptian Pharaoh of the Early Dynastic Period. He is most known for uniting Upper and Lower Egypt and by doing so creating the First Dynasty.

Neithhotep is thought to either be his queen consort or daughter.

# Menes
Menes is a mythical pharaoh who is credited with uniting Upper and Lower Egypt. With very little archaeological evidence from the Early Dynastic period mentioning Menes it is thought that Menes is another name for Narmer or possibly Hor-Aha. The majority of egyptologists believe Menes and Narmer are the same, Menes being the prenomen/nebty name and Narmer being the Horus name.

The reason behind the uncertainty is that the contemporary archaeological evidence only uses the Horus name while most New Kingdom era king lists uses the personal name (usually prenomen or nomen).

Menes according to myth either united Egypt or was given the throne by [[Horus]].
