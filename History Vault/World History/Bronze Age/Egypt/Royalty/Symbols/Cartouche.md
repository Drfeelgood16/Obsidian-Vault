The cartouche is a symbol that indicates that the text inside of it is a royal name. The Cartouche looks like an oval with a line tangent to one end of it. It is usually vertical with a horizontal line at the bottom but it can be used horizontally with a vertical line like in this example.

The history of the cartouche goes as far back as the end of the Third Dynasty.
