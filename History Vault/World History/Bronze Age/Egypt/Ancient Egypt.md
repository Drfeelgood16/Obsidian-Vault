## Predynastic or Prehistoric Egypt
The earliest finds from Egypt dates as far back as the Paleolithic where some Acheulean tools have been found. Evidence of settlers exist as far back as the Mesolithic period but most settlements were temporary. It wasn't until the continued expansion of the desert and with the advent of agriculture in the Neolithic period that people settled down along the Nile.



It is disputed where this period ends and the Early Dynastic begins.

The majority of archaeological finds are from [[Upper Egypt]] because the civilizations in the [[Nile]] delta have been buried under the silt that the Nile carries.
