Arsenical Bronze is an alloy made with copper and arsenic. Since copper is naturally found contaminated with arsenic, only alloys with arsenic content over 1% by weight is called Arsenical Bronze. This fact also makes it hard to determine when arsenic was deliberately added to make this alloy. What we do know is that at some point it was intentionally added since we have found arsenic-free copper at a site.


Arsenic in copper have several advantages, which is why people think it was added to make the alloy. Arsenic can lower the amount of oxygen in the metal which will make the metal more ductile after casting. The alloy also has better potential for work-hardening than pure copper has. It can also make the bronze tools have a silvery sheen.

Arsenic bronze was still in use during much of the [[Bronze Age]]. The reason for the switch into tin [[Bronze]] is twofold. Firstly is in it's ease of gauging how much tin that is added since it could be added directly in the manufacturing process.
