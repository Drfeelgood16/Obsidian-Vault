Prehistory spans from about 3.3 million years ago to around 3000 B.C.E. It spans from the first known use of stone tools by [[Hominini]] to the beginning of ancient/recorded history with the creation of writing. This length of time varies between locations since for example in Australia it would last until 1788. But usually it is defined by the first civilizations to develop writing. Which were in Sumeria, Indus Valley, and in Egypt in the early bronze age. With most other civilizations following their footsteps in the Iron Age.

Prehistory is usually divided into three ages: The stone age, the bronze age, and the iron age. Though the latter periods do overlap with the beginning of written or ancient history. With the lack of a written history the main resource for historians is archaeological.
