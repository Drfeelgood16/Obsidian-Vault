The levallois technique is a way to refine the edges of a stone before knapping off a sharp piece to be used as a tool. The way this is done is by first knapping of small pieces of a core to prepare a striking point. Which when you strike will produce bigger and sharper flakes than the earlier [[Oldowan]] methods.

[Example of using Levallois Technique to make several tools from a single rock and using the rest of the core to make a hand axe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW0-_-6M_Oo) Note how unlike the Wikipedia animation his technique is more about preparing the strike point than it is about forming the edge before he knaps a piece off.
