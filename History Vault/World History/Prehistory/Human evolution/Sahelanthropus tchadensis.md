Sahelanthropus tchadensis is the first species to arguably be part of the human family. It is one of the earliest [hominin](Hominini) fossil that scientist believe walked upright. We only have cranial material but the place and size of the hole where the spine enters the skull make it likely that this primate walked upright.

It was found in northern Chad in 2001.
