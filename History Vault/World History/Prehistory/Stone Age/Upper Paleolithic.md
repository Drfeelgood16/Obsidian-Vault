The Upper Paleolithic happened between 50 000 and 12 000 years ago. About 50 000 years ago was when [[Homo sapiens]] migrated out of Africa into Eurasia. At around the same time was when the [[Neanderthals]] went extinct.

The first known cases of settlements happened in this age. Usually in valleys where migrating game passed by. The peopling of Australia and the Americas happened during this age.

Unlike the previous ages the Upper Paleolithic went through several technological stages which in order are the [[Aurignacian]] 40-28 ka, [[Gravettian]] 28-22 ka, [[Solutrean]] 22-17, and the [[Magdalenian]] 18-10 ka all of which are associated with [[Homo sapiens]].

The bow and arrow was invented early in this era and have been found in the Fa-Hien Lena Cave in Sri Lanka.
