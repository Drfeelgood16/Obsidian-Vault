The earliest member of the Homo genus is Homo habilis which evolved at around 2.8 million years ago.  The reason Homo habilis is part of a new genus is because of its use of tools called [[Oldowan]] technology. But with recent fossils showing that Australopithecus afarensis used tools a million years before Homo habilis[^1] it is now argued that Homo habilis ought to be part of the Australopithecus genus. It was long thought that Homo habilis was the ancestor of the Asian Homo erectus but it is now known that they both existed at the same time making it likely they shared a common ancestor instead. Instead Homo habilis is now believed to be the ancestor to the African Homo ergaster. But there are competing theories like Homo erectus migrating back to Africa and becoming Homo ergaster.
