Latin name: *Denisova hominins* was originally discovered in Denisova Cave in Siberia, henceforth the name. Unlike the [[Neanderthals]] denisovans have few surviving remains. Denisovans and Neanderthals are more closely related to each other than to [[Homo sapiens|humans]]. Unlike Neanderthals who lived mostly in Europe and West Asia Denisovan fossils have mainly been found in East Asia.

Most of the evidence of Denisovans is from DNA evidence, not from fossils.

Denisovans have interbred with humans to a larger surviving extent than Neanderthals with around 5% DNA in Oceanic Aboriginal peoples like the Aboriginal Australians.
