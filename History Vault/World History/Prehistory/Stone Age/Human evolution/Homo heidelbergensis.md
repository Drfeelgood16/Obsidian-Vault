Homo heidelbergensis is by convention the closest ancestor of [[Neanderthals]], [[Denisovans]], and [[Homo sapiens]]. While [[Homo erectus]] was the first known ancestor to use fire, fire was an essential part of Homo heidelbergensis's life. Late [[Acheulean]] technology was commonplace during this time and hafting simple tools started occuring. With the common use of fire the conquering of northern Europe happened.
