The stone age is the period in [[Prehistory]] where mankind mainly used simple stone tools to cut, prick or hammer with. The period ended when mankind discovered metalworking and proceeded into the bronze age somewhere between 4000 B.C.E and 2000 B.C.E.  

The stone age refers only to what tools were being used and only partly to what cultural or societal developments that happened during these times. This is due to our only source of knowledge from this era coming from archaeological evidence. It is harder to infer cultural or cognitive development without a written record.

It is common to show a stone age man living contemporaneously with dinosaurs but there is no evidence of it. In fact the earliest human-like fossil, the [[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]], is only 6 million years old while dinosaurs are said to have died out 66 million years ago.

# Stages

The Stone Age can be further divided into several stages with their own industries and cultures.
## Lower Paleolithic
The lower paleolithic spans from the earliest creation of [[Chopping tools]] from rocks using the [[Oldowan]] method which is from 3.3 Million years ago to 300 000 years ago. It ends when the [[Mousterian]] method brings in the [[Stone Age]]. It is not known whether control of fire originates from the lower or middle Paleolithic.

[[Homo habilis]], [[Homo erectus]], and [[Homo heidelbergensis]] lived in this period.
## Middle Paleolithic
The middle paleolithic lasts roughly between 300 000 and 50 000 B.C. and is characterized by the use of fire and the use of flake tools using the [[Mousterian]] industry which uses the [[Levallois Technique]]. The Middle Paleolithic is preceded by the [[Stone Age]] and succeeded by the [[Stone Age]]. This is also known as the era where [[Neanderthals]] lived.

The Middle Paleolithic also holds the earliest evidence of [[Behavioral modernity]] it, however, only becomes common during the [[Stone Age]]. The first known cases of burials happen in this era. Some archaeologists believe that cultures during the Middle Paleolithic might have believed in a religion with an afterlife because of these burials. This era also holds the earliest undisputed artistic works. In addition the Middle Paleolithic also holds the earliest evidence of long-distance trade.

Middle Paleolithic people were also the first to fish for food and to cure meat to make it last longer. Cannibalism was still common during this era. Though it is disputed if it was culturally fine, for religious reasons, or through need. Cooking food happened for the first time in this era though it is disputed if we only cooked food to thaw it or if we did it for nutritional or culinary reasons.

There were many other industries other than the Mousterian during the Middle Paleolithic like the Chatelperronian, Micoquien, and Sangoan to name a few.
## Upper Paleolithic
The Upper Paleolithic happened between 50 000 and 12 000 years ago. About 50 000 years ago was when [[Homo sapiens]] migrated out of Africa into Eurasia. At around the same time was when the [[Neanderthals]] went extinct.

The first known cases of settlements happened in this age. Usually in valleys where migrating game passed by. The peopling of Australia and the Americas happened during this age.

Unlike the previous ages the Upper Paleolithic went through several technological stages which in order are the [[Aurignacian]] 40-28 ka, [[Gravettian]] 28-22 ka, [[Solutrean]] 22-17, and the [[Magdalenian]] 18-10 ka all of which are associated with [[Homo sapiens]].

The bow and arrow was invented early in this era and have been found in the Fa-Hien Lena Cave in Sri Lanka.

The Franco-Cantabrian region is the most populated region during the Upper Paleolithic. It is a geographic region near the Pyrenees including most of southern France and the very top of Spain.![[Franco-Cantabrian region.gif]]
It is this regions industries that have previously been listed. There exist other less widespread cultures like the Ahrensburg Culture.
## Mesolithic
The Mesolithic spans the years of 20 000 years ago to 5 000 years ago but the age differs geographically. In the Levant for example it spans between 20 000 to 5 000.

Signifiers of this era are the smaller "microlithic" tools and a change from hunting megalomania into a more hunter-gatherer style of life. This was later replaced by macrolithic tools in the [[Stone Age]]. Pottery and textiles were also used in some parts during this era.

Settlements during this era are usually close to waters which offer a good supply of food.

This era ended when the Levant brought with it the [[Stone Age]] age. But even long into the [[Stone Age]] age there were still Mesolithic hunter-gatherers.

In Scandinavia there was no Mesolithic age, instead moving from "Äldre stenåldern" to "Yngre stenåldern."

Art from the Mesolithic is less plentiful than the art from the preceding and succeeding eras.
## Pre Pottery Neolithic
The Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) is the early era of the Neolithic. As its name tells us this era still hadn't discovered pottery. But it still has a lot of commonalities with the Neolithic like the use of agriculture and permanent settlements.

This era can be divided further into Pre-Pottery Neolithic A through C.
### Pre-Pottery Neolithic A
The Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) is based on the Natufian culture, a late  [[Epipalaeolithic]] culture from the Levant. But new technology is also introduced with the transverse-blow axe and [[Adze|adzes]]. The people during this era cultivated grains and stored them in granaries but were still hunting for food. Houses in this era were round, half-underground, had stone foundations with walls made of unfired clay bricks.

### Pre-Pottery Neolithic B
Domesticated animals were used to greater effect in this era which means we needed to spend less time hunting. The houses from this era have rectangular foundations instead of the circular ones in the PPNA.
## Neolithic
The Neolithic dated 8 000 - 4 500 BC is the age after the [[Stone Age]] when man discovered agriculture and therefore settled in permanent settlements.

The effect of agriculture in the Neolithic was less diversity in food and nutrition but a huge leap in effectiveness in production of said food. This increase allowed humans more time doing things other than gathering and hunting which inevitably lead to further improvements in technology. This effectiveness also rapidly grew the population. Which was in turn balanced out by increased mortality from diseases.

The Neolithic can, in the Levant and and the [[Fertile Crescent]] be divided up into three [[Stone Age]] eras (A-C) and the [[Stone Age]].

This era lead to the earliest civilization in [[Sumeria]] which will herald in the [[Bronze Age]].

### Culture in the European Neolithic era
![[European Late Neolithic Culture.svg.png]]

People lived in small tribes in the Neolithic era with little social stratification. States instead formed with the advent of metallurgy. Though it is argued that with some larger structures like burial mounds and towers that one explanation behind the construction of these is that one or a few persons organized and directed human labour. There exist evidence that some fortifications might have been constructed during this era.

The characteristic lithic technology during this era are the ground and polished tools. Before this era all stone tools were flaked to get their edge which even with the latest [[Stone Age]] technology leads to quite the rough edge compared to the edge you get from grinding. This new technology is what allowed settlers to clear woods for farming. The Native Americans maintained this level of technology until Europeans reached their lands.

The best example of a Neolithic village is Skara Brae on the west coast of Mainland, Orkney, Scotland. The Ggantija in northern Malta is the oldest freestanding structure in the world was constructed in this period (3600 - 2500 BC).
## Late Neolithic
Also known as the Pottery Neolithic. It is the final part of the [[Stone Age]] period. It lasts between the discovery of pottery until the discovery of copper metallurgy that brings in the [[Chalcolithic]] Period (7000 - 4500 BCE).

In the Badia aka the Syrian Desert the first pastoral societies emerged.

In sites in northern [[Mesopotamia]] archaelogists have found sculptures of women that are thought to be similar to the [[Mother Goddess]] sculptures found later in the Neolithic.

In the later Ubaid culture the first depiction of the [[Master of Animals]] is found.

# Life in the Stone Age

Man lived as hunter-gatherer nomads in the majority of the Stone Age. As hunter-gatherers a community settled town in an advantageous spot for hunting and when their prey migrated man migrated with them. Life was mostly spent gathering food and creating tools.

It wasn't until the Neolithic that mankind started cultivating crops. With the development of agriculture and pastoralism it was no longer necessary to live a nomadic life. Instead man settled down where it where it was prosperous. These settlements then turned into towns and the towns turned into the first civilizations. This development was mainly focused in the [[Fertile Crescent]] but other cradles of civilization also developed almost simultaneously.

When man started settling they started living in towns which eventually turned into city-states ruled by kings, priestesses, or god-emperors. Neighboring city-states warred constantly over borders and other disputes.
