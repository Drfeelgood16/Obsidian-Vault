The Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) is the early era of the Neolithic. As its name tells us this era still hadn't discovered pottery. But it still has a lot of commonalities with the [[Late Neolithic]] like the use of agriculture and permanent settlements.

This era can be divided further into Pre-Pottery Neolithic A through C.
## Pre-Pottery Neolithic A

The Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) is based on the Natufian culture, a late  [[Epipalaeolithic]] culture from the Levant. But new technology is also introduced with the transverse-blow axe and [[Adze|adzes]]. The people during this era cultivated grains and stored them in granaries but were still hunting for food. Houses in this era were round, half-underground, had stone foundations with walls made of unfired clay bricks.

## Pre-Pottery Neolithic B

Domesticated animals were used to greater effect in this era which means we needed to spend less time hunting. The houses from this era have rectangular foundations instead of the circular ones in the PPNA.
