 "This idea is upsetting to the so-called experts who insist that the only humans who existed duringthe Ice Age wer simple hunter-gatherers."

The timeline that the archaeologists put forward is that civilizations emerged around 6 000 years ago. However, new discoveries keep pushing that horizon back. One of which is Gunung Padang whose initial evidence has confounded mainstream archaeologists because it calls into question every thing that they have taught us.

What if an advanced civilization flourished here during the Ice Age. A civilization that has been lost to history.

"For a long while, archaeologists thought it was just another hill in the jungle"

Archaeologists thought that the stones were a natural formation of volcanic rock. But upon further inspection we can see that they have been cut and placed.

The blocks were imported. Ali Akbar found a second cultural layer that is from around 5 200 BC.

Is there any source for Natwidjaja's incredible digital reconstruction of Gunung Padang as a step pyramid?

Can you really for certain know that these are chambers with ERT GPR and ST? Could there really be no other explanation?

Why do you suddenly need archaeologists to excavate the site? Why not fund and do it yourself to get actual proof?

The only way taht 20 000 year old dirt prove anything is if you can actually prove that humans interacted with that dirt.

So the archaeologists believe that it is a man made structure after all. Why present them earlier as if they didn't?

An advanced civilization couldn't move out of a sea rise that takes 800 years to fill?

The idea of the great flood doesn't have to invented separately, it could have simply spread.

Science should be able to change its mind, as should you when presented with facts casting doubt on your conclusions.
