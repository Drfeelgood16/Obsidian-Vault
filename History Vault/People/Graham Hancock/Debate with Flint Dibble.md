Graham Hancock was Joe Rogans first real guest.

**F:** The archaeological historiography is not derived from a single source or theory but from a vast data set from many sites and the finds within. From the finds we can gather much information through measuring isotopes like carbon-14. For instance the different diets in different seasons.

Dibble is here to to test the Lost Civilization Hypothesis posited by Graham Hancock. This hypothesis believes that there is a lost global advanced civilization from the ice age. He believes that it is this civilization that is the cause for the sudden appearance of agriculture across the world in the cradles of civilization. It was also they that taught humans architecture, astronomy, and the arts.

Graham himself says that he has no direct evidence, only the fingerprints left from a "lost civilization."

The two disproofs of a lost civilization is the vast amount of Ice Age evidence that Graham ignores, even the evidence that exist from underneath the ocean where he says archaeologists aren't looking, and the evidence of domestication from food. The oldest domesticated crops is from about 11 000 years ago from the fertile crescent. It isn't even possible that plants could have been domesticated elsewhere.

The records from archaeologists in this day and age is mostly open. The data shows that there is no linear trajectory to human culture and that it is quite heterogeneous. The advancement of culture is quite localized.

The idea of the "Birth of civilization" is a Modernist grand narrative that us postmodernists don't belive in anymore.

Graham believes that the civilization from 12 000 years ago was advanced as the turn of the 19th century. This civilization didn't have metallurgy though. Why can't we find shipwrecks from this global civilization among the 3 million shipwrecks already found? Underwater preservation would have kept it intact for at least 20 000 years.

Archaeologists publish whatever they find, they do not hide it. Archaeologists aren't locked in to a certain picture of the past so if new evidence says another thing than what is currently believed the archeologists will eventually follow.

Summary of ideas stated.
1. Archaeologists follow the vast amount of data gathered and do not blindly follow their grand narrative, that is a thing of the past.
2. The current data says that there is no linear progression in human culture. The "Birth of Civilization" is therefore an outdated idea.
3. Modern day archaeologists publish all their data and do not hide it.

Counters to Grahams Hypothesis
1. Graham ignores vast amounts of Ice Age data in making this hypothesis. 
2. We do know an approximate time and area in which food domestication first developed.
3. (Not stated as such) Why would a lost civilization that supposedly is as advanced as ours was during the Napoleonic wars not have discovered metallurgy?
4. Why haven't we among the 3 000 000 shipwrecks discovered found any ships from this supposed lost seafaring global civilization?

**G:** This is the first time an archaeologist have debated this with me.

I believe this civilization, like most, emerged out of shamanism. They had an advanced astronomy and a knowledge of the world\[?]. Like for example they had solved the longitude problem which wasn't solved by us until the 18th century.[^1]

The longitude problem require a way to synchronize the time between two distant places. In the past you either used two clocks or some global event like an eclipse. In modern days the telegraph was used and nowadays the longitude is accurate down to a centimeter by the use of satellites. Does he mean that this ancient civilization invented precise chronometers without pendulums so that they could be used at sea, all without metallurgy? Even if they didn't use chronometers are you telling me they had telescopes?
