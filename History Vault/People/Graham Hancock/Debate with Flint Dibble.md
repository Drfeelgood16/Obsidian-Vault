Graham Hancock was Joe Rogans first real guest.

**F:** The archaeological historiography is not derived from a single source or theory but from a vast data set from many sites and the finds within. From the finds we can gather much information through measuring isotopes like carbon-14. For instance the different diets in different seasons.

Dibble is here to to test the Lost Civilization Hypothesis posited by Graham Hancock. This hypothesis believes that there is a lost global advanced civilization from the ice age. He believes that it is this civilization that is the cause for the sudden appearance of agriculture across the world in the cradles of civilization. It was also they that taught humans architecture, astronomy, and the arts.

Graham himself says that he has no direct evidence, only the fingerprints left from a "lost civilization."

The two disproofs of a lost civilization is the vast amount of Ice Age evidence that Graham ignores, even the evidence that exist from underneath the ocean where he says archaeologists aren't looking, and the evidence of domestication from food. The oldest domesticated crops is from about 11 000 years ago from the fertile crescent. It isn't even possible that plants could have been domesticated elsewhere.

The records from archaeologists in this day and age is mostly open. The data shows that there is no linear trajectory to human culture and that it is quite heterogeneous. The advancement of culture is quite localized.

The idea of the "Birth of civilization" is a Modernist grand narrative that us postmodernists don't belive in anymore.

Graham believes that the civilization from 12 000 years ago was advanced as the turn of the 19th century. This civilization didn't have metallurgy though. Why can't we find shipwrecks from this global civilization among the 3 million shipwrecks already found? Underwater preservation would have kept it intact for at least 20 000 years.

Archaeologists publish whatever they find, they do not hide it. Archaeologists aren't locked in to a certain picture of the past so if new evidence says another thing than what is currently believed the archeologists will eventually follow.

**Summary 1**
1. Archaeologists follow the vast amount of data gathered and do not blindly follow their grand narrative, that is a thing of the past.
2. The current data says that there is no linear progression in human culture. The "Birth of Civilization" is therefore an outdated idea.
3. Modern day archaeologists publish all their data and do not hide it.

Counters to Grahams Hypothesis
1. Graham ignores vast amounts of Ice Age data in making this hypothesis. 
2. We do know an approximate time and area in which food domestication first developed.
3. (Not stated as such) Why would a lost civilization that supposedly is as advanced as ours was during the Napoleonic wars not have discovered metallurgy?
4. Why haven't we among the 3 000 000 shipwrecks discovered found any ships from this supposed lost seafaring global civilization?

**G:** This is the first time an archaeologist have debated this with me.

I believe this civilization, like most, emerged out of shamanism. They had an advanced astronomy and a knowledge of the world\[?]. Like for example they had solved the longitude problem which wasn't solved by us until the 18th century.[^1] They also observed phenomena such as the precession of the equinoxes.

You say that archaeologists are willing to change their views according to the data. Let's challenge that.

What is your view on the [Clovis first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_culture) thesis?

---

**F:** I was taught that there was people here before Clovis.

**G:** Clovis is a town near the site of Blackwater Draw which for a long while thought to be the earliest human presence in america and it's first culture. It was dated to about 13 400 years ago, it was thought that there was an ice-free corridor in the Bering strait that allowed humans to pass to America by land. This theory was questioned in the 90s.

The idea was that there was a single common origin to the native american people. In contrast there have been recent discoveries showing a close relationship between the australasians and Amazonians. There have been publishing during the 2010s disproving the Clovis first theory.

Archaeologists can be incredibly mean to people who disagree with them. An example of this is Jacques Cinq-Mars who found proof of people existing before the Clovis culture.[^2] The reaction to his find ruined his academic career even though he was right.

Even though you say Clovis first was debunked in the 90s there are papers debunking it in 2007 and 2012. If it was debunked in the 90s why is it being debunked 20 years later.

The find in Monte Verde by Tom Dillehay was also challenged by archaeologists. In a clip of Dillehay he talks about the closed-mindedness of some North American archaeologists.

The Society of American Archaeology sent a letter to Netflix asking them to reclassify *Ancient Apocalypse* to science-fiction instead of documentary. In a way trying to censor or cancel me. I don't think archaeologists are in a conspiracy against me, just that they are locked in a certain mindset that makes my ideas seem preposterous.

**Summary 2:**
 1. When proof was discovered disproving the Clovis first theory, the archaeological community did not follow it like you said it would. Instead it fought tooth and nail discrediting the archaeologists who found said proof and their work.
 2. Why is the Clovis first theory being debunked in 2007 and 2012 when it, as you said, was debunked in the 1990s
 3. I do not believe that there is a conspiracy against me just that archaeologists are too locked into a certain mindset. A mindset that tries to destroy any theory that is even remotely contrary to their own. In doing so destroying careers and threatening livelihoods, even my own.

**G:** How much of the Sahara has been excavated.

**F:** A bunch if has been surveyed and a lot of desert archaeology does not have excavation because of wind erosion. We know about the domestication of the Pearl millet from when the desert was habitable in the African Humid Period.

**G:** Let me clarify, Has the Sahara been excavated so that there is no possibility that anything could have been missed?

**F:** We have found thousands of sites of ephemeral hunter-gatherer remains in the Sahara.

**G:** Still not answering, how much of the Sahara has been excavated?

**F:** I don't know but quite a bit. Due to remote sensing, surface survey, and due to archaeological excavation we have reasonable coverage across the Sahara. We can see agricultural villages in the Neolithic and hunter-gatherer societies before the Neolithic.

**G:** Around 1% of the Sahara has been excavated. So to say that there are no possibility of traces of a lost civilization is a bit premature. Particularly since the Sahara was green during the African Humid Period. There is a map by a 15th century Genoan that even shows a river flowing through the Sahara. This river has been located under the sand by surveys. Sahara is an underserved area in archaeology.

Same with the Amazon, 95% of the Amazon has not been investigated. There is evidence of geoglyphs in the Amazon. While so much land has yet to be examined, archaeology can not definitely rule out a lost civilization.

Same with the seas, only a fraction of 1% has been investigated. There is still so much undiscovered that ruling out a lost civilization is not possible.

I have personally done some diving and found several interesting megaliths at places in the pacific ocean.

**F:** I see no evidence man making some of these megaliths. Even some of the pictures of supposed stone steps show natural fractures along straight lines. It is easy to confuse what can happen naturally with something that looks anthropogenic, this example does not look man made.

**G:** My skeptic archaeologist friend believes after seeing them that they are real.

In the waters between Sri Lanka and India there is thought by the locals to be an underwater city that their nets sometimes catch on. Do you think this is man made?

**F:** The pictures are too blurry to tell. (Even Rogan agrees.)

**G:** Me and my wife have no funding to do these dives and we risk our lives doing these. If there was an actual investigation I believe that so much more could be found.

How much of the developed world do you think has been investigated?

**F:** I do not disagree with you that much more excavations and their funding are needed. I am not arguing against surveying these locations. 

I think our coverage is better in developed countries because laws require archaeological excavations before allowing constructions. So millions of sites have been investigated with billions of finds. It's not perfect and these excavations done before a project might not have the same rigor as a university funded one. I am not saying archaeology has perfect coverage, but we do have an extensive coverage that people might not be familiar and a lot of it comes from this late Ice Age Period we are discussing.

(Joe brings the discussion back to the pictures of stone steppes in yonaguni)

**F:** I see no resemblance between this and known human architecture. In fact you can see the straight faultlines in the stone.

*There are differing thoughts between two geologists mentioned on whether these are man made or not.*

**G:** It is inconceivable to me that the circle of stones was not human made.

In fact the entire area is much greater than what is shown in these pictures.

The last place on Earth that i would look for a lost civilization is in northern Europe since 13 000 years ago it was a frozen wilderness.

There is no targeted search for a lost civilization because archaeology already believes that no such thing exists.

**Summary 3**

**G:** Claims
1. Very little of the Sahara, Amazon, and the oceans have been surveyed. The places most likely to find a lost civilization from the late ice age, so to say that a lost civilization is impossible is dumb.
2. These pictures taken during my dives in the Pacific and the Gulf of Mannar show that people created great monuments when the ocean level was low around 12 000 years ago.

**F:** Counterclaims
1. I agree that we need more excavations. (Authors note lack of evidence against your claim is not evidence for.)
2. These monuments don't look like any human architecture I recognize and these things can happen naturally. For example the fault lines among the rock in Yonaguni look straight so there being steps there could just be natural erosion.

**F:** The site of Pavlopetri in the Aegean Sea is a underwater city off the coast of Greece. We have not only found man-made structures there but also artifacts like ceramics and tools. The blocks there for example are in several courses.[^3] This shows that this was an occupied place. The city of Helike, who is thought to be Plato's Atlantis, also shows similar structures.

Therefore we do find from more recent times actual underwater structures that look very unlike the ones Graham showed.

**G:** Are you saying these are natural blocks at Pavlopetri

**F:** No, you can see clear stone courses that look like the architecture that exist above ground. Unlike the ones at Yonaguni who don't look like any known architecture.

**G:** Looks like megalithic architecture to me like the ones at Sacsayhuaman.

**F:** We see many different blocks at Sacsayhuaman. We see multiple courses of blocks stacked on top of each other.

**G:** Have you been to Sacsayhuaman?

**F:** No, I have never been.

**G:** So how can you talk about it?

**F:** Because I've seen photos of it.

**G:** Well I have been there dozens of times.

(Joe interrupts this obnoxious argument from Graham to get back to the point.)

**G:** Sacsayhuaman is a very complicated site with courses of blocks but it also has rock cut areas with steps in them.

**F:** I don't see how having been let's you talk about it better than me. You have been there as a tourist to see how archaeologists have preserved it and presented it for people coming by. That is different than excavating a site and understanding archaeological literature. Telling me that because I've not been there means I can't talk about it is preposterous.

**G:** You're ignorant of the site. You do not know what it looks like. You don't know the huge areas cut out of solid rock.

(Looks at images of Sacsayhuaman)

**G:** That's the blocky walls you are looking at

**F:** Yeah, those look nothing like Yonaguni.

**G:** But they confront another area that does.

**F:** There is still actual dating that needs to be done in Yonaguni.

(Shows rock hewn part of Sacsayhuaman)

**F:** That looks nothing like Yonaguni. It looks like a room was cut out to the left.

(Discussion of the picture and Joes view on it)

**J:** How old is Sacsayhuaman?

**G:** That's an ongoing argument

**F:** [Pedro Cieza de León](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Cieza_de_Le%C3%B3n) (1520 - 1554) mentioned it was only built a hundred years before he was there

**J:** The difference between Yonaguni and Sacsayhuaman is that the latter also show what is clearly human architecture with the stone blocks fitted and piled on each other. You do not see that at Yonaguni, but the sights are so bizarre that it is hard to believe that they weren't man-made.

**G:** I believe if we were to look further we would find more evidence that Yonaguni was man made. I'm bringing these points up to address Flints apparent point that archaeology has don enough to rule out the lost civilization theory.[^4] That is what is said in the letter to Netflix from the SAA.

**Summary 4:**
**F:** In sites in the Aegean sea like Pavlopetri we find courses of rocks placed on top of each other and also artifacts like pottery and stone tools. This is unlike the site at Yonaguni which only has these megalithic rock-hewn steps.

**G:** The steps at Yonaguni look similar to the ones at Sacsayhuaman.

**F:** The steps at Yonaguni don't look man-made like the ones at Sacsayhuaman. Sacsayhuaman doesn't only have these rock-hewn steps, they also have several courses of hewn rock placed on top of each other and the site has been dated.

**G:** If more work is done at Yonaguni I believe it would prove that these were man-made also.

---

**J:** What is your thought on the idea that South America would be the place where an advanced lost civilization might have lived.

**F:** I think we still might need to find some kind of evidence like agriculture. We can look at the development of agriculture in South America and Meso America and see the development from wild to domesticated crops in real time.

There is evidence throughout much of Meso America and much of northern South America of the domestication of crops. We only have evidence from the edges of the rain forest though. We have done a lot of work in the rainforest with lidar and have found structures along major roads that date to about 2500 years ago.

The key thing is that we want clear dates for stuff. If we look at the Ice Age stuff where Graham says we're not looking

**G:** I merely say you're not looking enough.

**F:** Okay, so when we do look at these areas like in Abydos, Egypt, near where we found much of the Pre-dynastic Egyptian sites (like Umm el Qa'ab) is 200 different sites dating from the Ice Age. In these sites they found dense scatters of lithics totaling to about 36 000 artifacts.

When talking about underwater sites we have found ice age sites off the coast of Florida. Also with mainly lithics from hunter-gatherer societies.

**J:** How are these sites for where to search chosen

**F:** In the video my colleague, Jessica Cook Hale, will explain how by mainly using predictive models based on the geomorphology and known sites above water they predict where the finds underwater will be.

**Summary 5:**
**F:** We need more evidence to prove an advanced civilization lived in the Amazon since the evidence we do have seem to be contrary.

The other places we have looked at like in Egypt or underwater we find only ephemeral hunter-gatherer societies.

We do not choose sites randomly, instead we use already known sites combined with geomorphological data to predict where we will find sites.

---

We are looking underwater which you can see in examples like Cosquer Cave which have the most carbon dating from it.

The Magdalenian culture that is associated with most of these painted caves dates from around the period of Grahams lost civilization. These sites are only a couple of miles from the Ice Age coast. There is not room for a lost civilization there (in the bay of Biscay.)

**G:** Not in the bay of Biscay, but there might be room in the Sunda shelf. I'm not saying that we aren't going to find hunter-gatherer sites underwater just that we haven't done enough to rule out the possibility of a lost civilization. Attacking me for suggesting that there might be a lost civilization while failing to investigate the areas where one might exist is not in a great character.

**F:** As archaeologists we are working from the known towards the unknown.

Why do we have so much evidence for hunter-gatherer societies but not from a global advanced civilization? A global advanced civilization would leave behind monuments far easier to find than that of hunter-gatherers. What we do get are hunter-gatherers interacting with these coastlines.

On Crete which is rising more than the waters because of tectonics we have investigated stone age caves which like all the others only have Paleolithic tools.

Archaeologists do not write article headlines, journalists do. Archaeologists have not been focusing on debunking Clovis first, rather they have been focusing on explaining how the Americas was peopled with the newer evidence.

**J:** How did you (Flint) feel about the reaction towards Dillehay?

**F:** I think it is complete bullshit for colleagues of mine to shoot down actual evidence. Archaeology, like any other community includes assholes. Most archaeologists do not focus on the peopling of Americas so calling out the entire community because of that reaction is insincere.

We are not just finding shipwrecks underwater. But of the shipwrecks we find, why are there none from this global seafaring civilization? This evidence does not disprove the hypothesis but makes it incredibly unlikely to be true.

**J:** Can we say that there is no evidence for a lost civilization for what they have studied?

**G:** Yes, but only so far as to what has been studied and the question of priorities still remain.

**Summary 6:**
**F:** In many places there isn't even room for a theoretical lost civilization.

**G:** You just haven't looked where there might be room for such a civilization.

**F:** Sure, but as archaeologists we are working from the unknown towards the known.

**Why is there no evidence of an advanced civilization? Wouldn't we have an easier time finding the remains of such a civilization compared to the remains of hunter-gatherers? Why have we found no shipwrecks of such a civilization either?**

Archaeologists aren't focusing on debunking Clovis I, journalists are. We don't write the headlines you cited. I do believe it was bullshit what happened to Dillehay, archaeologists should not ignore actual evidence.

At the island of Bimini in the Bahamas there is the controversial geological structure of Bimini road. Are you familiar with it and the work around it?

**F:** Since I am not a geologist, I'll say no. But I've heard from other geologists that it is not man-made.

**G:** According to this old map that seem to depict Bimini from 12 000 years ago there seem to be a road running up the middle of it.

**F:** You know what would convince me? If you would geo-rectify these maps with a GIS-expert to see how they line up with real space. With these tools you could statistically measure how similar they are and that would make these maps a lot more convincing.

**G:** That's a good idea.

A lot of the work around the Bimini Road comes from an article of Eugene Shinn whose 1978 article contradicts much of what is currently believed about this formation.

(Shows a video of Eugene Shinn joking about planting artifacts)

Even if he wasn't sincere joking about it is in bad taste.

**F:** In Histria, what is sometimes referred to as the Romanian Pompeii, when we dug up roads that were found using magnetometry we do not find anything like the Bimini road. Instead we find roads packed with pottery and animal bones in order to increase drainage. With most roads found you will get plenty of artifacts along with them and even if the animal bones might not survive underwater the pottery would. For example in the thousands of shipwrecks that we find most of what is left is the wood the ship is made out of and the pottery that it carried. Finding artifacts along the roads is not only localized to Europe but is found all over the world.

**J:** How much searching has been done at Bimini?

**G:** A great deal of work has been done by amateurs whom have been scorned by archaeologists. I don't claim that the Bimini road is a road, instead that it is a anthropogenic megalithic structure.[^5] All we know is that there are blocks placed next to each other and even some blocks placed on top of other blocks.

The stones weigh a couple of tons each. They measure to about 12 feet on one side and 15 feet on the other. They're fairly uniform in size and in many cases propped up on blocks underneath them. If it was naturally made the bedding plane would slope, instead it is horizontal. This fact has been missed in the geological literature.

**F:** This does not look to me to be man-made. If it were made by a global civilization why have we found no similar architecture anywhere else? Even the places Graham visits in *Ancient Apocalypse* don't look like this.

**J:** We're dealing with different parts of the world right?

**F:** Yeah, that's my point. It is not the same culture. (A single global culture is what we would find if Grahams hypothesis is correct.)

**J:** If you found this structure as a part of a known dated archaeological site wouldn't you think it is man made?

**F:** Not necessarily, for example there was a circular depression right at the middle of a stone structure at this site north of Pylos. There was much debate on whether it was man made or not until geologists observed it and said that it was not man made.

**J:** That's not the same as the structure we find at Bimini.

**Summary 7:**
**G:** In the sea next to the island of Bimini in the Bahamas there is a structure consisting of stone blocks laid in a row next to each other. This corresponds to a map from the 16th century which sourced more ancient maps that has a road driven in what looks like what Bahamas would have looked like during the ice age.

A lot of the work around Bimini road has been disputed by a single geologist whom I deem not credible considering jokes he has made.

**F:** This doesn't look anything like any ancient road I've seen. For example in Histria the road dug up there is filled with animal bones and shards of pottery to improve drainage. Both of which ought to survive in underwater conditions, especially the pottery. These structures also look nothing like the examples Graham presents in his show *Ancient Apocalypse* which goes against his theory of a global civilization.

**J:** If you were to find this structure next to a known site, wouldn't you think it was man made?

**F:** Not necessarily, there have been similar examples of a perfect circle found in the middle of a stone structure that was proven not to be man made.

**G:** Flint is not simply an outside observer in all this controversy. He has for example added fuel to the fire in the recent Homo Naledi controversy. You attempted to smear Lee Berger, but he was too big for you to bring down. Instead you moved on to attack Danny Hilman Natawidjaja who was a smaller and easier target. You portrayed Gunung Padang as a pyramid scheme, which is an insult in itself.[^6]

In an interview with Dr. Lutfi Yondri you character assassinated Danny.

**F:** Lutfi Yondri did major excavations at Gunung Padang.

**G:** There's a conflict of interest between Lutfi Yondri and Danny Hilman. I'm way more interested in the way you guys present this paper and the mockery of it.

[Shows video with Dibble, Lutfi Yondri, and Harry Sofian talking about the paper.](https://youtu.be/-DL1_EMIw6w?t=6243)

Note the dishonest framing of Harry Sofian talking about archaeologists. Completely skipping Harrys point that the clip was leading up to: That archaeologists should tell the truth. [Clip with full context](https://youtu.be/UxaHo3V4lGg?t=2011).

In the video Harry Sofian criticize the article for only having one archaeologist, Ali Akbar, while having 11 geologists including Danny Hilman Natawidjaja. Flint criticizes their method of identifying artifacts. **The rest of the clips are so short you can't even be sure of what they even are saying.**

Flint might have little influence on Youtube but he has a great influence with journalists. In an article with the guardian[^6] he is quoted criticizing the methodology used in Gunung Padang. This is a site that I focused on in the first episode of my Netflix show. Danny Hilman in his peer-reviewed article presents evidence that Gunung Padang at the base of it could be about 25 000 years old.

Because his finding was presented in my show there was an excessive amount of pressure directed against Danny the result of which being the retraction of the paper. Danny asked for criticisms to be published along with the article but alas it was not so.

Flint and his colleagues has created a huge fuss in the media about me \[cites a youtube video from https://www.youtube.com/@Heavenly_Valor with the title "Satan loves Graham Hancock the most" that has been removed. Most popular video from this youtuber is "Satan HATE$ Black People The Most" with 13K views as of 23/4/2024.] 

**J:** Joe correctly points out that you can't connect Flint to this crazy guys youtube channel. This guy would have gone after you even if Flint did nothing.

**F:** The media rarely ever got in touch with me until you announced this conversation over a year ago. Since then I've gotten journalists wanting me to make comments on things related to your show.

**Summary 8:**
**G:** Flint is not innocent in this media spectacle. He partially fueled the fire in the Gunung Padang controversy that got Danny Hilman Natawidjaja's paper retracted.

**F:** You were the reason for the media taking interest in me after announcing this debate over a year ago.

---

**J:** What evidence is there in Gunung Padang?

**G:** The evidence is years of dedicated work that is published in that paper that was retracted. \[Not an answer, give examples]

**J:** Why were you (Flint) laughing at the tool presented from Gunung Padang?

**F:** Because I don't think it was a tool, it looks nothing like any human made tool I've ever seen. The excavator of the site agrees with me on that assessment as well. The tool was never described in the article. The part of the videos where we go in depth about this subject was cut out of the video Graham presented. [[Summary of Flint Dibble video on Gunung Padang]] 

In the paper they don't even go into detail about this artifact. PArt of the reason why we were laughing about it was because Lutfi Yondri was snubbed after working on that site for several decades.

**G:** The issue here is not that artifact. Danny Hilman has done years of work here with GPR, ERT and ST and his conclusion is that there is a chamber under Gunung Padang.

**F:** Note that there is a question mark after where it says tunnel or chamber.

**G:** My view is that this work needed to be taken much more seriously instead of instantly being dismissed like it has been. Lutfi Yondri has not done any work looking into the depth of Gunung Padang instead focusing only on the topsoil.

We don't have time to go into any of the methods in depth. The results have been published extensively. Danny Hilman has posted a refutation on my website.

[^1] The longitude problem require a way to synchronize the time between two distant places. In the past you either used two clocks or some global event like an eclipse. In modern days the telegraph was used and nowadays the longitude is accurate down to a centimeter by the use of satellites. Does he mean that this ancient civilization invented precise chronometers without pendulums so that they could be used at sea, all without metallurgy? Even if they didn't use chronometers are you telling me they had telescopes? 

His source for this belief are maps from the renaissance that supposedly depict islands as they were 12 000 years ago. He believes the authors of these maps copied older maps that were in turn drawn by someone from this ancient civilization 12 000 years ago.

[^2] https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/jacques-cinq-mars-bluefish-caves-scientific-progress-180962410/ read 2024/04/18

What was done to Jacques Cinq-Mars was definitely an overreaction but is it necessarily bad to have a conservative point-of-view in academia? Einsteins theories was also discredited until he proved it with experiments. I think it is better to move gradually instead of constant paradigm shifts and the consensus right now agrees with Cinq-Mars findings. I honestly think that the Bluefish Caves finds laid the foundation for archaeologists to accept the finds at Monte Verde. Once is a fluke, twice is cause for consideration.

[^3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_(architecture)

[^4] Flint never even said anything close to this.

[^5] If Bimini road wasn't a road, what was depicted on the map you presented earlier?

[^6] [Guardian article about the subject](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/dec/16/really-really-weak-experts-attack-claim-that-indonesia-site-is-worlds-oldest-building) 
[Paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/arp.1912) which has been [retracted](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/arp.1932) though the authors disagree with the retraction.

Main issue seem to be that there were no human artifacts next to the material that was carbon-14 dated. Quote by Flint Dibble in article:


“If you went to the Palace of Westminster and dropped a core seven metres into the ground and pulled up a soil sample you might date it as being 40,000 years old,” said Dibble. “But that does not mean the Palace of Westminster was built 40,000 years ago by ancient humans. It just means there’s carbon down there that’s 40,000 years old. It is extraordinary that this paper has been published.”
