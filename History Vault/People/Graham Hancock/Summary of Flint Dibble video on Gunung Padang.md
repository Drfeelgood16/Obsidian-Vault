Dr. Lutfri Yondri has excavated at Gunung Padang and written a dissertation about it in the doctoral program in Padjadjaran Univeristy.

Harry Sofian has published on several prehistoric archaeological topics in Indonesia. He is mostly focused on archaemetallurgy aka on ancient metals.

The paper presented evidence including cores which they gathered for radiocarbon dating. They also did a range of prospecting including Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), Electro Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and Seismic Tomography (ST). Using a drilled core that is going tens of meters down instead of excavating to measure dates is problematic.

According to the paper Gunung Padang is not a natural hill but a pyramid-like construction.

Meticulously sculpted andesite is not mentioned anywhere in the paper except for in the conclusion. This statement is therefore not supported with any proof from within the paper.

The evidence does not support the statement that Gunung Padang is a pyramid or pyramid-like. Instead it is a terraced hill. The paper doesn't even provide a definition of a pyramid but the consultant Graham Hancock does. He defines a pyramid as a structure that rises in a series of terraces to a summit and classifies Gunung Padang as a step-pyramid. Graham's definition would include most human settlements on top of hills. Looking at the pyramid of Djoser we can see it looks nothing like Gunung Padang.

The authors own speculations are included in the diagrams at points. Examples of this usually is followed by a question mark like when in their diagram showing the trench they dug and supposed steps one meter away from their dig they point to it with an arrow labeled "Step?"

(Dashed line is trench dug. Dotted line is pure speculation assuming there is a step.)![[Trench Diagram.jpg]]

Another example is from their ERT diagram where they find an area with lower resistivity and label it as "Tunnel?" There could, of course, be other reasons for low resistivity than the existence of a tunnel. Especially considering the geologic conditions where Gunung Padang lies.

The way they dated Gunung Padang leaves a lot to be desired according to Flint Dibble. The method used involve drilling as deep as 10 meters into the ground from the surface at different locations from the surface. Then using the carbon from these "cores" that was drilled to date the site. The problem with this is that usually the deeper you dig the older the dirt gets. So dating anything requires artifacts from the same level that you get you sample from, something that the authors have not done.

In fact there are very few archaeological artifacts or ecofacts mentioned in the paper. Context can only be derived from anthropogenic artifacts and context is needed to properly date something. The only artifact mentioned is a knife-looking object that in the paper is referred to as a *Kujang Stone*. The object itself doesn't really look anything like a Kujang dagger from which it is likened to.

There is no mention of the "amulet" that Natawidjaja is supposed to have found in Gunung Padang by Natawidjaja. Probably because they know now that it was simply a coin made in the 1900s. 

A problem with the paper is that only one archaeologist is credited as an author. Meanwhile there are 11 geologists listed as authors. The authors never got in touch with either Lutfi Yondri or Harry Sofian while Graham Hancock was allowed to review the paper before it was published. The main author
