Dr. Lutfri Yondri has excavated at Gunung Padang and written a dissertation about it in the doctoral program in Padjadjaran Univeristy.

Harry Sofian has published on several prehistoric archaeological topics in Indonesia. He is mostly focused on archaemetallurgy aka on ancient metals.

The paper presented evidence including cores which they gathered for radiocarbon dating. They also did a range of prospecting including Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), Electro Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and Seismic Tomography (ST). Using a drilled core that is going tens of meters down instead of excavating to measure dates is problematic.

According to the paper Gunung Padang is not a natural hill but a pyramid-like construction.

Meticulously sculpted andesite is not mentioned anywhere in the paper except for in the conclusion. This statement is therefore not supported with any proof from within the paper.

The evidence does not support the statement that Gunung Padang is a pyramid or pyramid-like. Instead it is a terraced hill. The paper doesn't even provide a definition of a pyramid but the consultant Graham Hancock does. He defines a pyramid as a structure that rises in a series of terraces to a summit and classifies Gunung Padang as a step-pyramid. But looking at the pyramid of Djoser we can see it looks nothing like Gunung Padang.
