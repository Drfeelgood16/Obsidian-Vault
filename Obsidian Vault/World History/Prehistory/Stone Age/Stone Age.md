The stone age is the period in [[Prehistory]] where mankind mainly used simple stone tools to cut, prick or hammer with. The period ended when mankind discovered metalworking and proceeded into the bronze age somewhere between 4000 B.C.E and 2000 B.C.E.  
  
The stone age is further divided depending on which types of tools were used. These stages are called the [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], and [[Neolithic]] respectively. The Paleolithic stage can also be subdivided into the [[Lower Paleolithic]], [[Middle Paleolithic]], and [[Upper Paleolithic]].

The stone age refers only to what tools were being used and only partly to what cultural or societal developments that happened during these times. This is due to our only source of knowledge from this era coming from archaeological evidence. It is harder to infer cultural or cognitive development without a written record.
