Behavioral modernity are traits that distinguishes us humans from all other species like abstract thinking, language and symbolic cultural behavior like dance and music.

While [[Homo sapiens]] is the same species as us humans. Homo sapiens didn't start with the same cognitive behavioral traits as us. It took about 150 000 years for Homo sapiens to acquire behavioral modernity.
