*"On October 30 2023 an estimated amount of 6000 bombs per week had been dropped on Gaza"* 3:34

Why is this relevant at all in February of 2024?

"If you think these numbers are made up, which the president said they were out loud in front of everybody." 3:49

The president said he doesn't trust the Hamas controlled gazan health ministry's numbers on Oct 25, 18 days after the war started. Why are we bringing this up four months later when other organizations and the IDF has confirmed the accuracy of the statements.

It is very fair for a president to wait for breaking news from a partisan source to be verified before talking about what to do with said information.

"According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs: 70 per cent of casualties are thought to be women and children"

actual source: https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-reported-impact-day-82

This source get's the entirety of it's numbers from the Hamas run gazan health ministry. The health ministry usually reports correctly the number of deaths, the same can't be said for it's breakdown of these casualties. The IDF has reported 12 000 Hamas fighters dead while a palestinian official has reported 6000 dead. Considering the total numbers of palestinians killed being around 30 000 are we to assume that the vast majority of men killed are Hamas fighters or is the health ministry fudging the numbers?

Also it is important to note that most sources will call an AK-carrying 16-year old a child, a term which will make most people think of someone prepubescent. Avoiding using morally loaded terms to be more accurate is not media speak you absolute buffoon. (4:20)

## Do you condemn Hamas

"It's actually a really easy question" 
Then why do you people have such a hard time answering it without justifying hamas in some way.
"That's why I condemn the war crimes Israel has committed before Oct. 7 and the ones committed after"
Why not also condemn Palestinian war crimes and terror attacks that happen before and after Oct. 7. Sure history didn't start with Oct. 7 but neither did it start with cast lead.
