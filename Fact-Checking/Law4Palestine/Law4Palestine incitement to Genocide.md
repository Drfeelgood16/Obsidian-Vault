# Decision Makers

1. Yoav Gallant is threatening that if Hezbollah starts a war with Israel they will be ready to respond. Unlike what the article wants you to think he is implying that the citizens of Lebanon will suffer because Hezbollahs actions when Israel would be forced to respond.
2. The source is a youtube playlist and I can't find anything through google so unless they fix their source I will call this a bunk claim.
3. Civilan deaths is most likely collateral damage so Netanyahu saying as much is not proof of"genocidal intent/civilan harm/collective punishment."
4. Netanyahu proclaiming that he will destroy Hamas and their hiding places is not "civilan harm/collective punishment."
5. Obviously you can't have a terrorist group continue leading Gaza after the terror attacks against Israel. Cultural change is not proof of *Actus Reus* according to the genocide convention either.
6. Saying that Israel will pursue Hamas south is not proof of anything.
7. In context he is obviously talking about combatants not all citizens.
8. Netanyahu letting fuel trucks through is proof of genocidal intent?
9. This says nothing, why is this statement even here? The writers note doesn't even make any sense either and provides no actual context.
10. This statement does not say what the writer thinks it says. Of course Netanyahu is not willing to give the Gaza Strip to the PA on a silver platter after this war but he is also correct in the assessment that the PA is not capable of ruling the Gaza strip.
11. There is no number eleven apparently. It existed in a previous version and Herzog is correct in saying that Gazans are complicit with Hamas's actions but requiring them to rise up to a dictatorial government is a bit over the board
12. These are fighting words but not proof of civilan harm/collective punishment. He is explicitly mentioning Hamas and not palestinians.
13. This is the same as no. 11
