## Topic: 1948 and the roots of the current situation

**Norman Finkelstein (N):** Norm believes the two states solution would have been sustainable if the zionist movement was faithful to the position proclaimed under the UNSCOP proceedings. Ben-Gurion testified at the time "I want to express what we mean by a jewish state. we mean by a jewish state simply a state where the majority of the people are jews. Not a state where a Jew has in any way any privilege more than any one else. . . . A jewish state means a state based on absolute equality of all her citizens and on democracy." ([Full Quote](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-178863/#:~:text=By%20the%20way%2C%20I%20want,is%20all%20we%20envisage%20here.)). 

But it didn't turn out that way, quoting from Benny Morris "Zionist ideology and practice were necessarily and elementally expansionist."[^1] and "Transfer was inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism – because it sought to transform a land which was ‘Arab’ into a ‘Jewish’ state and a Jewish state could not have arisen without a major displacement of Arab population; and because this aim automatically produced resistance among the Arabs which, in turn, persuaded the Yishuv’s leaders that a hostile Arab majority or large minority could not remain in place if a Jewish state was to arise or safely endure."[^2] Benny Morris later added that "A removing of a population was needed. Without a population expulsion, a Jewish state would not have been established."[^3]

**Benny Morris (B):** The UNSCOP, Peel Commision and UNGA all agreed that a two state solution was the way to proceed in this matter. The problem was that the arabs rejected even the principle of partition believing that the jews ought not to have any part of Palestine. They even went so far as to say that Jews living as a minority in a unified Palestine was unacceptable. Instead, the Arabs launched a war against the resolution and against the Jews in Palestine. It was the Arabs losing this war that led to the first Arab-Israeli war where the neighboring Arab countries invaded Mandatory Palestine with the same goal of preventing the creation of a Jewish state.

The quote Norm used is out of context. The full context of Bennys statement about transfer is that it was only necessary after the hostilities towards the Jewish community by the arabs and if the arabs had accepted partition instead of warring against the Jews transfer would not have been necessary. The arab populations were then driven out and were not allowed to return by the Jews because they just tried to destroy the Jewish state.

**Mouin Rabbani (M):** The nature of Zionism and the unfairness of the partition plan made the Nakba happen, not the arabs starting a war against the Jewish population that accepted the partition. In fact the partition plan was only passed because the UN at the time only consisted of imperial powers. Had the African and Asian sovereign nations existed at the time they would have been the clear majority in opposing the partition plan.

The reason why a Palestinian state wasn't created wasn't by a lack of want, instead it was prevented by the collusion between the Israelis and the Jordanians.

**Steven Bonnell aka Destiny (D):** The narrative around this question can be summarized like this: "The arabs were ethnically cleansed by the jews in 1947 in an event called the Nakba or catastrophe." But you usually never hear the context around or the reasons why the arabs were pushed out during the 1947-1948 wars. The fact that the civil war was started by arabs because they rejected the partition plan, rejected living with jews, rejected any exclusively Jewish state is glossed over. Mouin previously brought up that the partition plan was rejected because it was unfair, conveniently glossing over the fact that Arab opposition to the plan was not because it was unfair but because the Jews were given any land at all.

The facts around this case is usually cherry picked to ascribe jews the brunt of the blame. The fact is that it was usually the arabs inability to be diplomatic that furthered this conflict and gave Jews a reason to continue fighting for more land. Had the Arabs at any point accepted the jewish state and sued for peace, Israel would have followed.

**N:** Mr. Bonnell referred to cherry picking and handful of quotes, let's see if we can hold you (Benny Morris) to any of your quotes.

 *Norm proceeds to misuse the exact quote that Benny Morris already responded to.*[^2]

The arab population rationally feared Zionism because it would lead to territorial displacement and dispossession.

**B:**  Mouin said that the Nakba was inevitable and predictable

**M:** As have you.

**B:** No, the Nakba was only inevitable because the Arabs assaulted the Jewish community and state. The refugee problem only exists because of this war the arabs started.

As Norman points out, I said transfer was inbuilt into Zionism in so far as the jewish land purchases before the British mandate. I wasn't talking about the 47/48 wars when writing that transfer was inevitable. My point, instead, is that transfer was inevitable when jewish evicted the few arab farmers that lived in the land that the jews legally purchased. 

Transfer was always a minority opinion, because the jews didn't want the beginning of a state to be on the basis of an expulsion. Transfer wasn't adopted in 48 even though Ben-Gurion didn't want an arab minority as a fifth column.

Transfer was a British idea that originates in the Peel Commission which the jewish leaders latched onto, but when the commission failed the jews fairly quickly stopped talking about transfer after '38.

**M:** One the one hand you are making the claim that transfer was a very localized phenomenon from individual land purchases but you're also claiming that a Jewish state requires an overwhelming reduction of the non-Jewish population.

**B:** Transfer was very localized before 1948, but became necessary when the Arabs attacked.

**M:** *Responding to Benny*
1. There is literature out there which demonstrates that transfer was envisioned by Zionist leaders on a broader scale than land purchases.
2. Arabs and Palestinians have been warning that the purpose of the Zionist movement was to create an exclusively Jewish state.

*Responding to Destiny*
The Palestinians have consistently been trying to persuade the international community and not only been focusing on war as you claim.

**D:** If you believe that the jews always had in mind the transfer of Arabs out of their Jewish state how do you square jews accepting both the 47 partition plan which would have a sizable Arab minority and that a few years later in Lausanne they were willing to allow around 200 000 Arabs to return to Israel?

**N:** Contrary to the "Old Historians" Benny Morris wrote that transfer was central in Zionist thinking.

**B:** I didn't say it was central to the Zionist Experience just that the idea was there.

**Lex Fridman (Host, L):** Is it okay to say that those quotes do not reflect the full context

**N:** That would be fine.

**D:** To be clear, the contention is that Norm is quoting a part and implying that the part is the whole while Benny Morris believes that the part is only a part.

**N:** Ideology doesn't operate in a vacuum. Jews couldn't just openly say that they wanted to expel Arabs and the Arab resistance grew out of fear for the Zionist ideology whose end goals were to expel the arabs.

**B:** You have said a number of times that Arabs said that the jews intended to expel us. Just because the Arabs said so doesn't mean it is true, some might have believed it and others might be using this belief as a political instrument but either way it doesn't prove the validity of the statement. Eventually it became a self-fulfilling prophecy when the arabs attacked. 

**L:** You (Norm) keep bringing up this line from the 25 pages and the four pages. We're luck to have Benny in front of us right now. Why not ask him?

**B:** Zionism was central to the Zionist enterprise up until about 20 years after the creation of Israel. Transfer, however, was never core to the idea of Zionism, the core of Zionism was to save the Jewish people by creating a state in their former homeland. A homeland that Arabs deny ever existed.

**M:** In "The Diaries of Theodor Herzl", Herzl being the founder of the Zionist movement, Herzl modeled Zionism after Cecil Rhodes and the colony of Rhodesia. In his diaries he states that it is essential to remove the existing population from Palestine and that we shall have to spirit the penniless population across the borders and procure employment for them elsewhere.

**B:** To put this into context --this is one paragraph from Herzl's diary that is five volumes. Only about one percent of his diary is devoted to the subject meaning it is not central to his idea of Zionism. His idea was to create a liberal democratic western state in Palestine not some imperial enterprise serving an imperial master like Rhodesia.

This also what both Weizmann and Ben-Gurion wanted also and through most of their years they envisioned an Arab majority living in this state.

**M:** What occupied much of Herzl's time was getting great power patronage to support "an outpost of civilization against barbarism." He saw his project as a proxy for Western imperialism in the Middle East.

**B:** He didn't see it as a proxy for western imperialism. What he wanted was to establish a Jewish state with the help of major imperial powers.
### Summary
Benny Morris, despite what Finkelstein thinks, has been pretty consistent on the view that transfer was an idea floating around in the Zionist ideology but it was never central to said ideology. Despite that Norm continues to quote an out of context sentence at Benny Morris that is supposed to prove that he used to think similarly.

Mouin Rabbani, meanwhile, does exactly what Destiny complains of in his opening statement. He cherry picks facts to try to paint Israel as the sole faulty party for the Nakba. His statement "the Nakba was the inevitable consequence of partition given the nature of Zionism, given the territorial disposition, given the weakness of the Palestinian community whose leadership had been largely decimated during a major revolt at the end of the 1930s, given that the Arab states were still very much under French and British influence, the Nakba was inevitable, the inevitable product of the Partition Resolution." I feel is especially disgusting, giving arabs no agency in the result of the conflict.

## Partition
**M:** If I understood you (Destiny) correctly you believe that Palestinians and Arabs would have rejected any partition resolution.

**D:** They would have rejected any partition and furthermore a lot of the land given in the resoution was in the Negev desert. The land given to the jews in this partition would also have had about 500 000 Jews, 400 000 Arabs, and 80 000 bedouins so the "Jewish land" was only about 50% Jewish.

**M:** The Palestinians did reject the partition plan outright that only served to rub salt in the wounds. Can you name a country that would give up even 10% of itself to solve the current Palestinian refugee problem. I think it was right to reject an exclusively Jewish state at the expense of those already living there and to say you should have accepted losing 55% of your land because you lost 78% of it was wrong.[^5]

**D:** The arab position was never about losing x percent of their land it was a matter of principle that they would not accept losing any land to the jews. The Arabs thought they were entitled to this land in which they never had an independent state or a ruling government in.

**M:** They did have a state during mandatory Palestine which provisionally recognized the independence of that territory.

**D:** The territory itself was recognized but it was never guaranteed that an arab government should emerge from it.

**M:** It was the British Mandate of Palestine not Israel.

**B:** The state Ben-Gurion envisioned would be a majority jewish state like the one they accepted in the 1947 resolution which would be 40% arab. So the idea of exclusivity wasn't in the air in 47-48.

**M:** I think it was there.

**B:**  Both arabs and jews regarded Palestine as their homeland but arabs don't recognize that the jews regard it as their homeland. The arabs, however, have always rejected sharing this land with the jews.

**D:** The Zionists have always been seeking the support of western nations. But if this was true how could Israel possibly have engaged in the transfer of 400,000 arabs after accepting the partition plan? Would it not have destroyed their legitimacy among western nations?

Full Context: There was always an idea of transfer at the beginning of the Zionist project. The only sure consequence of this idea ruminating was how easy it was to gloss over the expulsions that happened alongside the Arab exodus during the 1948 war. But unlike what the quote implies, the idea of population transfers was nothing more than a pipe dream before 1936, where it was more seriously and openly discussed and it only became necessary in the 1947-1948 wars when native Arabs threatened to become a fifth column.

[^5] Author's notes:
1. Palestine was not a country at the time and hasn't been sovereign since the jews lived there. A country that has been sovereign for hundreds of years, not as a region of a larger country, but self-executing is not comparable to the situation in Palestine in '48
2. The arabs might have been just in fighting the wars in '48, '56, '67, '73 but at some point war isn't justified and to my mind the second intifada was the point were the conflict stopped being murky and entirely the fault of the Arabs and their supporters.
3. If you initiate a war and then lose said war, you can't expect to be able to keep negotiating from the same position as before the war. Therefore in hindsight your only two options are losing a war and accepting less than the plan, or accepting the plan. What the arabs instead decided to do was to pretend that you won a war in which they lost.
