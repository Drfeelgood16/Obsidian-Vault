(A/HRC/55/73) in case of dead link

### Summary
*After five months of military operations, Israel has destroyed Gaza. Over 30,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 13,000 children. Over 12,000 are presumed dead and 71,000 injured, many with life-changing mutilations. Seventy percent of residential areas have been destroyed. Eighty percent of the whole population has been forcibly displaced. Thousands of families have lost loved ones or have been wiped out. Many could not bury and mourn their relatives, forced instead to leave their bodies decomposing in homes, in the street or under the rubble. Thousands have been detained and systematically subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment. The incalculable collective trauma will be experienced for generations to come.*

*By analysing the patterns of violence and Israel’s policies in its onslaught on Gaza, this report concludes that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the threshold indicating Israel’s commission of genocide is met. One of the key findings is that Israel's executive and military leadership and soldiers have intentionally distorted jus in bello principles, subverting their protective functions, in an attempt to legitimize genocidal violence against the Palestinian people.*

## Introduction

### Summary
It cites radical partisans in this conflict and the South African ICJ case to come to the conclusion that "there are reasonable grounds to believe that the threshold indicating Israel's commision of a genocide is met." The conclusion does not follow, the ICJ case only went so far as to say it is "plausible", a standard that is way lower than "reasonable grounds." Plausibility is the same as saying it is possible while reasonable grounds implies it is probable.

Furthermore she writes "Israel’s actions have been driven by a genocidal logic integral to its settler-colonial project in Palestine" something that has yet to be proven.

#### Footnote 2
Her footnote has no relevance to the sentence it corresponds to. In fact her mandate according to OHCHR is as follows: 

*The mandate of the Special Rapporteur derives from the 1993 resolution from the Committee of Human Rights. The mandate calls on the Special Rapporteur:

1. *To investigate Israel's violations of the principles and bases of international law, international humanitarian law and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967;*
2. *To receive communications, to hear witnesses, and to use such modalities of procedure as he may deem necessary for his mandate; and*
3. *To report, with his conclusions and recommendations, to the Commission on Human Rights at its future sessions, until the end of the Israeli occupation of those territories.*

So it is true that she has no responsibility to rapport on Hamas's actions but that is because her position is focused solely on Israels violations. This says nothing about her being limited solely to the occupied territories, just that she is limited to Israels actions. Therefore the term "geographic scope" would not be correct unless it's used in an esoteric manner.

#### Footnote 3
These numbers come from the Gazan Health Ministry and should be taken with a pinch of salt.

#### Footnote 4
Using the dates of Operation Protective Edge from Wikipedia (2014-07-08 - 2014-08-26) I get 2 231 casualties but this is a minor error and could be about interpretation or even just a typo.

#### Footnote 5
Do note that she is sourcing herself among the experts. TI would love to which of the experts have input into this article. I would argue that the expert who has the oPt mandate would have most influence, but the article is written as if they had equal input and were all in agreement.

#### Footnote 6
The author of the article is credentialed but a radical. [Another article written only six days after Oct. 7 by him.](https://jewishcurrents.org/a-textbook-case-of-genocide) Choice quotes from the article: 

*Israel’s campaign to displace Gazans—and potentially [expel them altogether](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/13/middleeast/egypt-rafah-crossing-gaza-palestinians-mime-intl/index.html) into Egypt—is yet another chapter in the Nakba.* 
(The article cited says nothing about Israeli plans to force Palestinians out of Gaza into Egypt, only Egyptian fearing an excess of Palestinian refugees and therefore completely closing the Rafah crossing.)

*But the assault on Gaza can also be understood in other terms: as a textbook case of genocide unfolding in front of our eyes. I say this as a scholar of genocide.*

*Under international law, the crime of genocide is defined by “the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such,”* \[...] *In its murderous attack on Gaza, Israel has loudly proclaimed this intent. Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant [declared](https://www.aljazeera.com/program/newsfeed/2023/10/9/israeli-defence-minister-orders-complete-siege-on-gaza) it in no uncertain terms on October 9th: “We are imposing a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting human animals, and we will act accordingly.”*
(It would most definitely be against the human rights of the Palestinians in Gaza to prevent food and water but it is not proof of Israels dolus specialis to genocide them. Also, Israel never really did completely stop humanitarian aid to reach Gaza.)

*Israel has also intensified its 16-year siege of Gaza*
Blockading is not the same as sieging.

**In summary:** This guy has gone off the deep end in his opinion on the conflict.

#### Footnote 7
Why are we using a statement from only Islamic states and a single video of the Brazilian Prime Minister? The arabic states are extremely partisan in this matter.


## Contextualizing genocide

#### Footnote 21
Citing the entirety of Rashid Khalidi's book. . .

#### Footnote 22
It is very dishonest to take a diary entry and quote it using the words "In 1940, Joseph Weitz, head of the Jewish Colonization Department stated." This is implying that he spoke these words in front of people and that it was a wide-spread wish, not his hidden personal opinion that was only written down in his diary and never acted upon.

#### Footnote 150
Is sourced from "Law 4 Palestine" a non-profit founded by Ihsan Adel who, on Oct. 7, justified the arab invasion into Israel. https://twitter.com/IhsanAdel1/status/1710745305807761526

The examples of "genocidal intent" given in the Law4Palestine article are either taken out of context or not proof of anything as laid out in [[Law4Palestine incitement to Genocide]].

#### Paragraph 50

All of her examples are taken out of context. Gallant and Netanyahu are clearly talking about Hamas and Herzogs statement is the same as saying Germans are responsible for the holocaust which is partly true.

She even misquotes Hagari. He never said "maximum damage" in the article, the full statement goes 

*We are using every piece of intelligence to maximize damage to meeting spots for terrorists planning to invade Israel, houses belonging to senior Hamas commanders, terrorist operational centers and headquarters and terrorist infrastructure.*

This is no longer a case of mistakes and just her outright lying.

Dichter is talking about minimizing civilian by forcing civilians to locate away from combat. But to be fair he also hints at annexing Gaza City.

Eliyahu is a member of Otzma Yehudit a far-right party that only has six members in the knesset. I'm sure we can find radicals in every country. Same with Gottlieb.

#### Footnote 162
This still requires proof of dolus specialis from the inciter. So even the three actually bad or iffy statements by themselves do not constitute proof of genocide. Human rights watch and the two cases cited even say as much. 

*“The elements of the offence of direct and public incitement to commit genocide under Article 2 3(c) of the Statute are described in both the Plea Agreement and the Tribunal jurisprudence as: 
	• that the accused incited others to commit genocide; 
	• that the incitement was direct; 
	• that the incitement was public; and 
	• **that the accused had the specific intent to commit genocide, that is, destroying in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial or religious group**.”*

#### Footnote 184
She is making a claim that Israel is distorting international law to their favour but there is no source as to how

#### Footnote 186
Article does not come to the conclusion that Israeli attacks are indiscriminate, just that they might be reckless in their proportionality calculations.

#### Footnote 187
Quoting from Bosnia v. Serbia para. 373:
*Turning now to the Applicant’s contention that the very pattern of the atrocities committed over many communities, over a lengthy period, focused on Bosnian Muslims and also Croats, demonstrates the necessary intent, the Court cannot agree with such a broad proposition. The dolus specialis, the specific intent to destroy the group in whole or in part, has to be convincingly shown by reference to particular circumstances, unless a general plan to that end can be convincingly demonstrated to exist; and for a pattern of conduct to be accepted as evidence of its existence, it would have to be such that it could only point to the existence of such intent.*

Para. 376: 
*The Court has already concluded above that — save in the case of Srebrenica — the Applicant has not established that any of the widespread and serious atrocities, complained of as constituting violations of Article II, paragraphs (a) to (e), of the Genocide Convention, were accompanied by the necessary specific intent (dolus specialis) on the part of the perpetrators. It also finds that the Applicant has not established the existence of that intent on the part of the Respondent, either on the basis of a concerted plan, or on the basis that the events reviewed above reveal a consistent pattern of conduct which could only point to the existence of such intent*

Croatia vs. Serbia Para. 148 (also footnote 44)
*The Court recalls that, in the passage in question in its 2007 Judgment, it accepted the possibility of genocidal intent being established indirectly by inference. The notion of “reasonableness” must necessarily be regarded as implicit in the reasoning of the Court. Thus, to state that, “for a pattern of conduct to be accepted as evidence of . . . existence of genocidal intent, it must be such that it could only point to the existence of such intent” amounts to saying that, **in order to infer the existence of dolus specialis from a pattern of conduct, it is necessary and sufficient that this is the only inference that could reasonably be drawn from the acts in question.** To interpret paragraph 373 of the 2007 Judgment in any other way would make it impossible to reach conclusions by way of inference. It follows that the criterion applied by the ICTY Trial Chamber in the Judgment in the Tolimir case is in substance identical with that laid down by the Court in its 2007 Judgment. *****

ICTR-96-4-T isn't even talking about genocide, only crimes against humanity in general.


She is citing cases that purport that dolus specialis can be inferred by actions but she has still not shown Israeli actions that the only inference that can be reasonably drawn is genocidal in nature. Hamas is not a protected group by the genocide convention and pretending that Israeli leaders are talking about Palestinians when they are talking about destroying Hamas is not proof of genocidal intent.

#### Footnote 200
Is making a grave accusation with only source being a Law4Palestine submission to the ICC which is forthcoming. Need I remind anyone why [[Law4Palestine incitement to Genocide|Law4Palestine]] ought to be uncredited.

#### Paragraph 60
The statements made by Israeli forces are not implyaing that all of Gaza city is allowed to be struck, only that Israel can strike them within the realm of proportionality. This is an extremely one-eyed view of these statements to come to that conclusion.

#### Para. 61
Israel is not implying that the entire population is a human shields. The author has yet to prove that Israel is performing attacks without considering proportionality.

#### Para. 62 
Aren't combatants deliberately moving within civilian populations a type of human shield. Why are you implying that it is wrong for Israel to say that hospitals and schools are connected to Hamas when evidence have come out that shows they are.

# Summary
The Special Rapporteur of the occupied Palestinian Territories is in this file trying to prove that the war going on in Gaza is a genocide perpetrated by Israel. In her attempt to prove that a genocide is ongoing she has to prove several things laid out in the filing:

1. The actus reus: the commission of any one or more specific acts against a protected group, namely: 
	* killing members of the group; 
	* causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
	* deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
	* imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
	* forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
2. The mens rea: the intent behind the commission of one or more of the abovementioned acts that must be established, which includes two intertwined elements.
	* a general intention to carry out the criminal acts (dolus generalis), and  
	* a specific intention to destroy the target group as such (dolus specialis)

Proving the actus reus is uncontroversial because everyone can see that the IDF is killing Palestinians. So at the very least Israel is committing 2 parts of the Actus Reus. But the most important part in proving a Genocide is proving the Mens Rea, or more specifically, the dolus specialis. She has to in her filing prove that Israel has a specific intent to wholly or in part destroy the Palestinian people. It is here that most cases falters because in most wars you can at the very least prove two parts of the Actus Reus, but proving that the intent behind these actions is genocidal in nature is very tricky.

In her report she cites several other cases that has proved a dolus specialis through inference, quoting from Croatia vs. Serbia paragraph 148: "in order to infer the existence of *dolus specialis* from a pattern of conduct, it is necessary and sufficient that this is the **only inference** that could reasonably be drawn from the acts in question." (Emphasis mine.) In short she needs to show a pattern of conduct in which the ***only*** inference as to the state of mind of the perpetrator is that of a genocidal one.

In this she fails. In three of her seven examples she is implying that the people speaking are talking about all Palestinians but with the proper context you can see that they were not referring to Palestinians, but to Hamas. Hamas is simply not a protected group under the genocide convention. Isaac Herzogs statement is blaming the Palestinian people for the Oct. 7 attacks the same way you could blame the German people for the holocaust, also not a genocidal statement. So the only proof of genocidal intent left after we take away the out of context statements of:

1. The President of Israel
2. The Prime Minister of Israel
3. The Defense Minister of Israel
4. An IDF spokesman
Are the statements of:
1. Minister of Agriculture
2. Minster of Heritage
3. Knesset member Revital Gottlieb

None of these people have direct input into the conflict in Gaza and using their statements as proof of genocidal intent doesn't have the same weight compared to the previous four. This leads me to speculate that the author knows she doesn't have the necessary evidence to prove genocide but didn't let that stop her.

After she fails to prove genocidal intent she starts rambling about how Israel misuses the laws of war to conceal their genocidal intent. Of course, as she does this she only look at what Israel has said and not that a lot of what has been said also has been proven. A lot of this part is unsourced speculation on her part and is entirety beside the point if you're trying to prove that a genocide is happening.

To end I will quote the US Congress when urging the UN to relieve Francesca Albanese of her position as Special Rapporteur in 24-02-2023

*Her biased behaviors should have no place at the United Nations, and clearly demonstrate the lack of impartiality. 
*Again, we strongly urge you to call for severing all ties with Ms. Albanese, help disband the Commission of Inquiry into Israel, and recommit to a United Nations system free from antisemitic and anti-Israel bias. We hope that you will instead work to bring Israelis and Palestinians together to ensure security, peace, and prosperity for all, and request a detailed accounting of what you are doing to tackle the antisemitism and anti-Israel bias endemic in the UN system.*

Clearly no attempt to free themselves from anti-Israel and antisemitism has been made by the UN.
