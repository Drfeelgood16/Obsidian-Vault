Neanderthals were the creators of the [[Mousterian]] technology. This technology used the [[Levallois Technique]] to great effect. Neanderthals were most likely capable of speech and is even thought to have some religious beliefs. Neanderthals are known to have created clothes, cook food, make use of medicinal plants, treat injuries, and cross seas. Neanderthals had some cold specific modifications stemming from them living in colder climates than their ancestors like body-fat storage and enlarged nose for the cold air. Their braincases are larger than modern humans.

There is evidence of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Homo sapiens interbreeding.

Neanderthals are classified as either Homo neanderthalensis or Homo sapiens neanderthalensis.

Neanderthals could have evolved as early as 430 000 years ago but the majority of the fossil record is from about 130 000 years ago and onwards.

Neanderthals and Denisovans are more related to each other than they are to Humans.

Neanderthals like humans grew out of a small population but unlike humans Neanderthals never proliferated as well. Their population size stayed pretty much constant until they died out.
