Homo sapiens is likely derived from [[Homo heidelbergensis]] at around 300 000 years ago in the horn of Africa. Homo sapiens is the name of our species. 

Homo sapiens is the first species to be distinctively similar to modern humans. But while Homo sapiens looks similarly to us modern humans some scientists argue that they might not yet have acted like modern humans. Most scientists believe [[Behavioral modernity]] appeared only about 170 000 years ago.

Humans migrated out of Africa in several waves as early as 270 000 years ago but it seems most of these migrating populations didn't survive. Instead it seems that it was the migration about 70 000 - 50 000 years ago that managed to survive. 

There were two routes that humans took out of northern Africa. The Southern route through the red sea into modern Yemen along the Arabian peninsula and throughout central Asia into modern India. Then there is the Northern route through the Levant and Anatolia into Europe.
