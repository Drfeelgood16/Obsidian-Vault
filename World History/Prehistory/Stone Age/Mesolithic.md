The Mesolithic spans the years of 20 000 years ago to 5 000 years ago but the it differs geographically. In the Levant for example it spans between 20 000 to 5 000.

Signifiers of this era are the smaller "microlithic" tools and a change from hunting megalomania into a more hunter-gatherer style of life. This was later replaced by macrolithic tools in the [[Neolithic]]. Pottery and textiles were also used in some parts during this era.

Settlements during this era are usually close to waters which offer a good supply of food.

This era ended when the Levant brought with it the [[Neolithic]] age. But even long into the [[Neolithic]] age there were still Mesolithic hunter-gatherers.

In Scandinavia there was no Mesolithic age, instead moving from "Äldre stenåldern" to "Yngre stenåldern."

Art from the Mesolithic is less plentiful than the art from the preceding and succeeding eras.
