The Mesolithic spans the years of 20 000 years ago to 5 000 years ago but the it differs geographically. In the Levant for example it spans between 20 000 to 5 000.

Signifiers of this era are the smaller tools and a change from hunting megalomania into a more hunter-gatherer style of life. Pottery and textiles were also used in some parts during this era.

Settlements during this era are usually close to waters which offer a good supply of food.
