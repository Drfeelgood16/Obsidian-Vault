The Neolithic dated 8 000 - 4 500 BC is the age after the [[Mesolithic]] when man discovered agriculture and therefore settled in permanent settlements.

The effect of agriculture in the Neolithic was less diversity in food and nutrition but a huge leap in effectiveness in production of said food. This increase allowed humans more time doing things other than gathering and hunting which inevitably lead to further improvements in technology. This effectiveness also rapidly grew the population. Which was in turn balanced out by increased mortality from diseases.

The Neolithic can, in the Levant and and the [[Fertile Crescent]] be divided up into three [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic]] eras (A-C) and the [[Late Neolithic]].

This era lead to the earliest civilization in [[Sumer]] which will herald in the [[Bronze Age]].
