The chalcolithic, also known as the copper age, is the age between the [[Neolithic]] and the [[Bronze Age]]. it occurred at different periods in different areas just like the surrounding eras. Some areas never had a copper age, instead moving directly into the Bronze- or [[Iron Age]]. The name Chalcolithic might be a bit misleading since the suffix -lithic might make it seem like this is another stone age.

The earliest finding of metallurgy is in the [[Fertile Crescent]] which are conical lead pieces. There is evidence of copper smelting contemporaneously with these lead pieces. But since lead is rare in this region it is possible that a culture somewhere else might have had invented lead smelting before copper smelting was discovered in [[Mesopotamia]].
